<h1><a name="Preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>This chapter is one of a series of chapters designed to teach you about 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in general and the Java Collections 
framework in particular. </p>
<p>In addition to studying these chapters, I strongly recommend that you study 
the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html">
Collections Trail</a> in
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html">Oracle&#39;s Java 
Tutorials</a>. The chapters in this eBook are intended to supplement and not 
to replace those tutorials.</p>
<h1><a name="Preview">Preview</a></h1>
<p>You learned in earlier chapters that the Java Collections Framework defines eight 
core interfaces, in two distinct trees.
One of the trees, which consists of six interfaces, is rooted in the interface named
<strong>Collection</strong>. The other 
tree, which consists of two interfaces, is 
rooted in the interface named <strong>Map</strong>.</p>
<p>You learned the names and the 
inheritance structure of those interfaces. You also learned about their 
purpose. You saw how the interfaces declare polymorphic methods that apply to 
implementations of the interfaces, and you learned about the optional methods of 
the <strong>Collection</strong> interface and the <strong>Map</strong> 
interface.</p>
<p>In this chapter you will learn that all of the implementations of the 
interfaces on the <strong>Collection</strong> side of the Java Collections Framework
<em>(the Collection hierarchy)</em> implement one of the sub-interfaces 
of the <b>Collection</b> interface. <em>(A similar discussion regarding the 
<strong>Map</strong> 
side of the Java Collections framework will be deferred until a future chapter.)</em></p>
<p>You will learn that a <b>Set</b> object cannot contain duplicate elements, 
but a <b>List</b> object can contain duplicate elements.</p>
<p>You will learn about the difference between <i>ordered</i> collections and <i>
sorted</i> collections. You will also learn about <i>ascending order</i> 
and the <i>natural ordering</i> of objects. </p>
<p>In addition, you will learn 
how more specialized stipulations are placed on interfaces as you progress down 
the interface inheritance hierarchy of the Java Collections Framework.</p>
<h1><a name="Generics">Generics</a></h1>
<p>The code in this series of chapters is written with no thought given to
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html">
Generics</a>. As a result, if you copy and compile the code, you will probably 
get warnings about <em>unchecked or unsafe operations</em>.</p>
<p>While you will ultimately need to understand how to use Generics, that is a 
very complex topic. An understanding of Generics is beyond the scope of this 
course. Therefore, for purposes of this course, you can simply ignore those 
warnings.</p>
<h1><a name="Discussion_and_sample_code">Discussion</a></h1>
<h2><a name="We_will_start_with_a_quiz">We will start with a quiz</a></h2>
<p>I am going to begin this chapter with a quiz . Is the following statement True 
or False?</p>
<blockquote>
	The <b>TreeSet</b> class is a direct implementation of the <b>Collection</b> 
	interface.</blockquote>
<p>The answer is False. </p>
<p>The <b>TreeSet</b> class is not a direct implementation of 
the <b>Collection</b> interface. Rather, the <b>TreeSet</b> class is a direct 
implementation of the <b>SortedSet</b> interface. The <b>SortedSet</b> 
interface extends the <b>Set</b> interface, and the <b>Set</b> interface extends 
the <b>Collection</b> interface.</p>
<p>The interface hierarchy for the Java Collections Framework is shown below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Collection
	<ul>
		<li>Set
		<ul>
			<li>SortedSet</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>List</li>
		<li>Queue</li>
		<li>Deque</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Map
	<ul>
		<li>SortedMap</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>As you learned in an earlier chapter, the Java Collections Framework doesn&#39;t 
have a single root. As shown above, there are two distinct trees in the 
framework -- The <strong>Collection</strong> hierarchy and the <strong>Map</strong> hierarchy.</p>
<h2><a name="The_root_of_the_Collection_hierarchy">The root of the Collection hierarchy</a></h2>
<p>The <b>Collection</b> interface is the root of the collection hierarchy. 
The Java Collections Framework doesn&#39;t provide any direct implementations of the <b>Collection</b> 
interface. All of the implementations of the interfaces in the <strong>
Collection</strong> hierarchy implement one of the sub-interfaces of the <b>Collection</b> 
interface. </p>
<h3><a name="What_does_Oracle_say_about_this">What does Oracle say about this?</a></h3>
<p>Here is what the Oracle documentation has to say on the topic of the <b>
Collection</b> interface: </p>
<p><i>&quot;The SDK does not provide any direct implementations of this interface: it 
provides implementations of more specific sub-interfaces like <strong>Set</strong> and 
<strong>List</strong>. This 
interface is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where 
maximum generality is desired.&quot;</i></p>
<p>The Oracle documentation also states:</p>
<p><i>&quot;Bags or multisets (unordered collections that may contain duplicate 
elements) should implement this interface directly.&quot;</i> </p>
<h2><a name="What_about_duplicate_elements">What about duplicate elements?</a></h2>
<p>Some implementations of <b>Collection</b> allow duplicate elements, and 
others do not. Implementations of the <b>List</b> interface <i>(such as 
<strong>ArrayList</strong>)</i> allow duplicate elements. Implements of <b>Set</b> and <b>
SortedSet</b> <i>(such as <strong>TreeSet</strong>)</i> do not allow duplicate elements. 
This was illustrated in an earlier chapter.</p>
<p>A sample program in that earlier chapter created two collection objects and applied 
the polymorphic <b>add</b> method to add the same elements to each collection. 
One of the collection objects was of type <b>ArrayList</b>, and the other 
collection object was of type <b>TreeSet</b>. The elements added to each 
collection contained one pair of duplicate elements. The duplicate element 
was automatically excluded from the <b>TreeSet</b> object, but was retained in 
the <b>ArrayList</b> object. </p>
<h2><a name="What_is_a_set">What is a set?</a></h2>
<p>According to Oracle, a <b>Set</b> is a <i>&quot;collection that contains no duplicate 
elements ... this interface models the mathematical set abstraction.&quot;</i> </p>
<p>An 
object of type <b>Set</b> is typically used to model collections such as Social 
Security numbers, where duplicates are not allowed. </p>
<h2><a name="What_is_a_list">What is a list?</a></h2>
<p>Also according to Oracle, a <b>List</b> is <i>&quot;An ordered collection (also known 
as a sequence). The user of this interface has precise control over where in the 
list each element is inserted. The user can access elements by their integer 
index (position in the list), and search for elements in the list.&quot;</i> </p>
<h2><a name="Ordered_is_not_the_same_as_sorted">Ordered is not the same as sorted</a></h2>
<p>Note that an <i>ordered</i> collection is not the same as a <i>sorted</i> 
collection. </p>
<p>The fact that the collection is ordered derives from the fact 
that each element in the collection has a specific position specified by an 
index. </p>
<p>In a sorted collection, the position of each element is determined 
by its value relative to the values of its predecessors and successors.</p>
<p>Oracle goes on to say, <i>&quot;Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate 
elements. More formally, lists typically allow pairs of elements e1 and e2 such 
that e1.equals(e2), and they typically allow multiple null elements if they 
allow null elements at all.&quot;</i></p>
<h2><a name="Is_ascending_sort_order_always_required">Is ascending sort order always required?</a></h2>
<p>Not all implementations of the <b>Collection</b> interface maintain the 
elements in ascending sort order. Some may, and others do not. For 
example, as discussed above, implementations of the <b>List</b> interface <i>
(such as <strong>ArrayList</strong>)</i> do not maintain their elements in sorted order at all. 
In other words, the position of an element in an <b>ArrayList</b> does not 
depend on the value of the element.</p>
<p>On the other hand, implementations of the interface named <b>SortedSet </b>
<i>(such as <strong>TreeSet</strong>) </i>and the interface named <b>SortedMap </b>do maintain their elements in 
sorted order. However, that order is not necessarily ascending. </p>
<p>When 
an object is instantiated from a class that implements the <b>SortedSet</b> 
interface, the sorting order for that object can be established by providing an 
object instantiated from a class that implements the 
<a href="../Java4090-%20The%20Comparator%20Interface,%20Part%201/Java4090.htm">Comparator</a> 
interface. In that case, the author of the class that implements the <b>Comparator</b> 
interface determines 
the order imposed on the elements in the collection. </p>
<h3><a name="Does_case_matter_in_String_objects">Does case matter in String objects?</a></h3>
<p>For example, if your <b>SortedSet</b> object contains references to <b>String</b> 
objects, the natural ascending sort would take the difference between upper case 
and lower case characters into account. 
</p>
<p>However, you might prefer that 
case be ignored when establishing the sorted order. You can accomplish 
this by providing an object of a class that implements the <strong>Comparator</strong> 
interface and which defines the <b>compare method </b>and the <b>equals</b> method in 
such a way as to eliminate case considerations for comparisons of <b>String</b> 
objects.</p>
<h2><a name="Sub_interfaces_have_more_stipulations">Sub-interfaces have more stipulations</a></h2>
<p>As you progress down the inheritance hierarchy, you find that additional 
stipulations apply at each level of inheritance. As an example, according 
to Oracle, <i>&quot;The Set interface places additional stipulations, beyond those 
inherited from the Collection interface, on the contracts of all constructors 
and on the contracts of the <b>add</b>, <b>equals</b> and <b>hashCode</b> 
methods.&quot;</i></p>
<p>The important point is that specific sub-interfaces of the <b>Collection</b> 
interface can define requirements that do not apply to all sub-interfaces of the
<b>Collection</b> interface. </p>
<h3><a name="Stipulations_on_set">Stipulations on set</a></h3>
<p>For example, the <b>add</b> method of the
<b>Set</b> interface stipulates the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	<i>&quot;Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present.&quot;</i></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the <b>add</b> method of the <b>Collection</b> interface 
simply states:</p>
<blockquote>
	<i>&quot;Ensures that this collection contains the specified element.&quot;</i></blockquote>
<p>Thus, the contract for the <b>add</b> method of an object of a class that 
implements the <b>Set</b> interface is more specialized than the contract for 
the <b>add</b> method of an object of a class that implements the <b>Collection</b> 
interface.</p>
<p>An additional stipulation on the constructor for a <b>Set</b> object is that 
all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements. </p>
<h3><a name="Stipulations_on_SortedSet">Stipulations on SortedSet</a></h3>
<p>The <b>SortedSet</b> interface extends the <b>Set</b> interface. The <b>
SortedSet</b> interface contains the following stipulation that makes it more 
specialized than a <b>Set</b>. </p>
<p><i>&quot;A set that further guarantees that its iterator will traverse the set in 
ascending element order, sorted according to the natural ordering of its 
elements (see 
<a href="../Java4070-%20The%20Comparable%20Interface,%20Part%201/Java4070.htm">Comparable</a>), or by a <strong>Comparator</strong> provided at sorted set creation 
time.&quot;</i> </p>
<h2><a name="We_will_end_with_a_quiz">We will end with a quiz</a></h2>
<p>I&#39;m going to finish this chapter with several questions in the form of a quiz. 
To ensure that this is a learning experience, I will provide an explanation in 
addition to the answer for each question. </p>
<h3><a name="Question_1">Question 1</a></h3>
<p>True or False? A collection that implements the <b>List</b> 
interface maintains its elements in ascending alphanumeric order.</p>
<p>The answer to question 1 is False. Unlike collections that implement 
the <b>SortedSet</b> interface, the order of the elements in a collection that 
implements the <b>List</b> interface is not based on the values of the objects 
referred to by the elements in the list. </p>
<h3><a name="Question_2">Question 2</a></h3>
<p>True or False? A collection that implements the <b>List</b> 
interface is an unordered collection.</p>
<p>The answer to question 2 is also False. A collection that implements 
the <b>List</b> interface is an <strong><em>ordered</em></strong> collection <i>(also known as a sequence)</i>. 
According to Oracle, <i>&quot;The user of the interface has precise control over where 
in the list each element is inserted.&quot; </i>Elements can be inserted and 
retrieved on the basis of their integer index <i>(position in the list)</i> 
using the following methods: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>add(int index, Object element)</b> </li>
	<li><b>get(int index)</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Valid index values are positive integers that begin with zero. When the
<b>add</b> method is used to insert an element at a specific position in the 
sequence, the element currently at that position <i>(if any)</i> and any 
subsequent elements are shifted toward higher index values to make room for the 
new element.</p>
<p>Another version of the <b>add</b> method takes a reference to an object as an 
incoming parameter and appends the specified element to the end of the 
collection.</p>
<p>The <b>get</b> method simply returns the element at the specified position in 
the collection.</p>
<p>The <b>List</b> interface also declares various other methods that can be 
used to manipulate the contents of the collection.</p>
<h3><a name="Question_3">Question 3</a></h3>
<p>True or False? A collection that implements the <b>List</b> 
interface is allowed to contain duplicate values.</p>
<p>The answer to question 3 is True. Unlike a collection that implements 
the <b>Set</b> interface, a collection that implements the <b>List</b> interface 
is typically allowed to contain duplicate values. More formally, according 
to Oracle, <i>&quot;lists typically allow pairs of elements e1 and e2 such that 
e1.equals(e2), and they typically allow multiple null elements if they allow 
null elements at all.&quot;</i> </p>
<h3><a name="Question_4">Question 4</a></h3>
<p>True or False? The contracts of the methods in the <b>
List</b> interface are the same as the contracts of the methods inherited from 
the <b>Collection</b> interface.</p>
<p>The answer to question 4 is False. According to Oracle, <i>&quot;The <b>List</b> 
interface places additional stipulations, beyond those specified in the <b>
Collection</b> interface, on the contracts of the <b>iterator</b>, <b>add</b>,
<b>remove</b>, <b>equals</b>, and <b>hashCode</b> methods.&quot;</i></p>
<p>For example, the <b>iterator</b> method <i>(for both the <b>List</b> and <b>
Collection</b> interfaces)</i> returns an iterator over the elements in the 
collection. For the <b>Collection</b> interface, there are no guarantees 
concerning the order in which the elements are returned by the methods of the <b>
Iterator</b> object.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <b>iterator</b> method for the <b>List</b> interface 
returns an iterator over the elements in the collection in proper sequence, 
where the sequence is determined by the numeric index. In other words, 
when you call the methods of the <b>Iterator</b> object on a <b>List</b>, the 
elements will be returned in the proper sequence as determined by a numeric 
index.</p>
<p>Similarly, according to Oracle, the <b>SortedSet</b> interface <i>&quot;guarantees 
that its iterator will traverse the set in ascending element order, sorted 
according to the natural ordering of its elements (see <strong>Comparable</strong>), or by a 
<strong>Comparator</strong> provided at sorted set creation time.&quot;</i> </p>
<h1><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter you learned that all of the implementations of the interfaces in 
the <strong>Collection</strong> hierarchy implement one of the sub-interfaces of the <b>
Collection</b> interface. You learned that a <b>Set</b> object cannot contain 
duplicate elements, but a <b>List</b> object can contain duplicate elements.</p>
<p>You learned about the difference between <i>ordered</i> collections and <i>
sorted</i> collections. You also learned about <i>ascending order</i> and 
the <i>natural ordering</i> of objects. In addition, you learned how more 
specialized stipulations are placed on interfaces as you progress down the 
interface inheritance hierarchy of the Java Collections Framework. </p>
<h1><a name="Whats_next">What&#39;s next?</a></h1>
<p>The <b>SortedSet</b> interface <i>&quot;guarantees that its iterator will traverse 
the set in ascending element order, sorted according to the natural ordering of 
its elements (see <strong>Comparable</strong>), or by a <strong>Comparator</strong> provided at sorted set 
creation time.&quot; </i>In the next chapter, I will show you how to use the <b>
Comparator</b> interface to control the sorted order of your collections.</p>
