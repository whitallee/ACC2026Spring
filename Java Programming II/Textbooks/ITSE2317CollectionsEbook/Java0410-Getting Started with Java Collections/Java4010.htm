<h1><a name="Preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>This chapter is one of a series of chapters designed to teach you about 
Object-Oriented Programming in general and the Java Collections 
framework in particular.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to the Java Collections Framework. Once you learn how to use the framework, it is unlikely that you will need to reinvent common data structures, search algorithms, or sorting algorithms 
ever again, because those capabilities are neatly packaged within the framework.</p>
<p>In addition to studying these chapters, I strongly recommend that you study 
the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html">
Collections Trail</a> in
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html">Oracle&#39;s Java 
Tutorials</a>. The chapters in this eBook are intended to supplement and not 
to replace those tutorials.</p>

<h1><a name="Preview">Preview</a></h1>
<p>This chapter provides a brief introduction to the use of the <em>Java Collections 
Framework</em>. The framework is designed to encourage you to reuse rather than to 
reinvent collections and maps.</p>
<p>A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements. Some 
collections allow duplicate elements while others do not. Some collections are 
ordered and others are not. <i>(Maps will be discussed in future chapters.)</i>
</p>
<p>The <em>Collections Framework</em> is defined by a set of interfaces and associated 
contracts, and provides concrete implementations of the interfaces for the most 
common data structures. In addition, the framework also provides several 
abstract implementations, which are designed to make it easier for you to create 
new and different implementations while still maintaining the structural 
polymorphic integrity of the framework.</p>
<h1><a name="Generics">Generics</a></h1>
<p>The code in this series of chapters is written with no thought given to
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html">
Generics</a>. As a result, if you copy and compile the code, you will probably 
get warnings about <em>unchecked or unsafe operations</em>.</p>
<p>While you will ultimately need to understand how to use Generics, that is a 
very complex topic. An understanding of Generics is beyond the scope of this 
course. Therefore, for purposes of this course, you can simply ignore those 
warnings.</p>
<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<h2><a name="A_little_quiz_">A quiz </a> </h2>
<p>Let&#39;s begin with a little quiz to establish your baseline knowledge of the 
Collections Framework. Take a look at the program in <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> near the end of 
this chapter. Which of the following is the output produced by that program?</p>
<ul>
	<li>A. Compiler Error</li>
	<li>B. Runtime Error</li>
	<li>C. 44321</li>
	<li>D. 12344</li>
	<li>E. 1234</li>
	<li>F. None of the above.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer was <b>1234</b> <em>(and it wasn&#39;t a guess)</em> then you may already know quite a lot about the 
use of the Collections Framework. If not, keep reading to begin learning about 
the framework.</p>
<h2><a name="Elements_of_the_Framework_are_easy_to_use">Elements of the Framework are easy to use</a> 
</h2>
<p>This simple introductory program is not intended to do anything useful. 
Instead, it was designed to illustrate several important features of the 
framework, including the ease with which elements of the framework can be reused 
in your programs. </p>
<h2><a name="Dont_reinvent_the_wheel_">Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel </a> </h2>
<p>As many of you already know, I am a college professor. I specialize in 
teaching OOP using Java. In the past, many college courses in Data Structures <i>
(often referred to as CS2 courses)</i> have emphasized the concept of <i>
reinventing the wheel</i>. Students were required to learn how to reinvent a 
variety of complex data structures in order to successfully complete the course.
</p>
<p>Hopefully, with the conversion of these CS2 courses to Java OOP, the emphasis 
will change to <i>reuse</i> instead of <i>reinvent</i>. </p>
<h2><a name="Collections_Framework_encourages_reuse">Collections Framework encourages reuse</a> 
</h2>
<p>The Java Collections Framework is designed to encourage programmers to reuse 
existing interfaces and classes instead of inventing new ones. In the event that 
it is necessary to invent a new class or interface, the programmer is encouraged 
to integrate it into the framework in a polymorphic manner.</p>
<h1><a name="Sample_program">Sample program</a></h1>
<p>I am going to provide a brief discussion of the sample program <i>(shown in 
<a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a>)</i> in this chapter. Later, I will provide more detailed discussions 
of many of the features used in that program.</p>
<h1><a name="InterestingCodeFragments">Interesting code fragments</a></h1>
<p>I will break this program down and discuss it in fragments. </p>
<h2><a name="An_object_of_the_TreeSet_class">An object of the TreeSet class</a> 
</h2>
<p>The code fragment in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> instantiates an object of the <b>TreeSet</b> 
class and stores the object&#39;s reference in a reference variable of type <b>
Collection </b>named<b>
ref</b>.</p>





<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. A new object 
				of the TreeSet class.
				</p>
				<pre>class Worker{
  public void doIt(){
    Collection ref = new TreeSet();
</pre>
</div><!--``2-->

<h2><a name="Collection_is_an_interface">Collection is an interface</a></h2>
<p>The <b>TreeSet</b> class implements the <b>SortedSet</b> interface, which 
extends the <b>Set</b> interface, which in turn extends the <b>Collection</b> 
interface. Thus, a <b>TreeSet</b> object <i>is a</i> <b>Collection</b>. 
Therefore, a reference to a <b>TreeSet</b> object can be stored in a reference 
variable of type <b>Collection</b>, and can be treated as the generic type <b>
Collection</b>. </p>
<h2><a name="What_is_a_TreeSet_object">What is a TreeSet object?</a> </h2>
<p>Among other things, in CS2 courses, we worry about the time and memory cost 
of a collection. According to Sun/Oracle, the <b>TreeSet</b> class guarantees that the 
sorted set will be in ascending element order, and provides guaranteed log(n) 
time cost for the basic operations (<i>add</i>, <i>remove</i> and <i>contains</i>).
</p>
<h3><a name="What_does_ascending_element_order_mean_">What does ascending element order mean?
</a> </h3>
<p>Again, according to Sun, the elements will be sorted according to the <i>
natural order</i> of the elements <i>(see the 
<a href="../Java4070-%20The%20Comparable%20Interface,%20Part%201/Java4070.htm">Comparable</a> interface)</i> or by a 
comparator <i>(see the 
<a href="../Java4090-%20The%20Comparator%20Interface,%20Part%201/Java4090.htm">Comparator</a> interface)</i> provided at the time the set is 
created. This depends on which overloaded constructor is used. I will have more 
to say about these alternatives in a future chapter. </p>
<h3><a name="What_does_log_time_cost_mean">What does log(n) time cost mean?</a> 
</h3>
<p>I&#39;m not going to try to explain the details of log(n) time cost here. Suffice 
it to say that the <i>add</i>, <i>remove</i>, and <i>contains</i> methods 
execute very fast.</p>
<h3><a name="A_TreeSet_object_is_a_Set_">A TreeSet object is a Set </a> </h3>
<p>An object of the <b>TreeSet</b> class also <i>is a</i> <b>Set</b>. One of the 
characteristics of a Java <b>Set</b> <i>(an object that implements the <strong>Set</strong> 
interface)</i> is that it can contain no duplicate elements. Therefore, a <b>
TreeSet</b> object can contain no duplicate elements. If the <b>add</b> method 
of a <b>TreeSet</b> object is called in an attempt to add a duplicate element, 
the element will not be added. </p>
<h3><a name="A_TreeSet_object_is_a_SortedSet_">A TreeSet object is a SortedSet
</a> </h3>
<p>The <b>TreeSet</b> class also implements the <b>SortedSet</b> interface. This 
guarantees that the contents of a <b>TreeSet</b> object will be in ascending 
element order, regardless of the order in which the elements are added. <i>(In a 
future chapter, I will discuss how comparisons are made to enforce the 
ordering of the elements.)</i> </p>
<h3><a name="A_TreeSet_object_is_a_Collection_">A TreeSet object is a Collection
</a> </h3>
<p>Because an object of the <b>TreeSet</b> class <i>is a</i> <b>Collection</b>, 
a reference to such an object can be passed to any method that requires an 
incoming parameter of type <b>Collection</b>. The receiving method can call any 
method on that reference that is declared in the <b>Collection</b> interface<b>.
</b><i>(I will discuss such methods in detail in future chapters.)</i> </p>
<h2><a name="Populate_the_Collection">Populate the Collection</a> </h2>
<p>The statement in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> passes the <b>TreeSet</b> object&#39;s reference 
to a method named <b>fillIt</b>, which is a static method of the <b>Populator</b> 
class. <i>(The Populator class is a class of my own design whose only purpose is 
to illustrate the polymorphic behavior achieved using the Collections 
Framework.)</i> The behavior of this method is to add elements to the incoming
<b>Collection</b> object without regard for the actual type of the object <i>
(the class from which the object was instantiated).</i></p>


<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. Populate the 
				collection.
				</p>
				<pre>    Populator.fillIt(ref);
</pre>
</div><!--``2-->


<p>At this point, I am going to discuss the <b>fillIt</b> method of the <b>
Populator</b> class called in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. The entire class definition of 
the <b>Populator</b> class, including the <strong>fillIt</strong> method, is shown in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a>.</p>

<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. The Populator 
				class. </p>
				<pre>class Populator{
  public static void fillIt(Collection ref){
    ref.add(new Integer(4));
    ref.add(new Integer(4));
    ref.add(new Integer(3));
    ref.add(new Integer(2));
    ref.add(new Integer(1));
  }//end fillIt()
}//end class Populator
</pre>
</div><!--``2-->



<h3><a name="Dont_know_dont_care_">Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care </a> </h3>
<p>As you can see in the above fragment, the <b>fillIt</b> method receives the 
reference to the <b>TreeSet</b> object as type <b>Collection</b>. This method 
doesn&#39;t know, and doesn&#39;t care, what the actual type of the object is. All it 
cares about is that the object <i>is a</i> <b>Collection</b> object. <i>
(Otherwise, the object&#39;s reference couldn&#39;t be passed in as a parameter. A type 
mismatch would occur.)</i> </p>
<p>Because the incoming parameter is a reference to a <b>Collection</b> object, 
the <b>fillIt </b>method can call the <b>add</b> method on the object with 
confidence that the behavior of the <b>add</b> method will be appropriate for 
the specific type of object involved. <i>(For example, the behavior of the 
<strong>add</strong> 
method for an object of the <strong>TreeSet</strong> class will probably be different from the 
behavior of the <strong>add</strong> method for an object of some other class that implements 
the <strong>Collection</strong> interface.)</i> </p>
<h3><a name="Polymorphism_in_action">Polymorphism in action</a> </h3>
<p>The great thing about polymorphic behavior is that the author of the <b>
fillIt</b> method doesn&#39;t need to be concerned about the implementation 
details of the <b>add</b> method. </p>
<h3><a name="Add_five_elements_with_some_duplicates_">Add five elements with some duplicates
</a> </h3>
<p>The code in the <b>fillIt</b> method adds five elements to the object. Each 
element is a reference to a new object of type <b>Integer</b>. Two of the 
objects encapsulate the <b>int</b> value 4, and thus are duplicates. </p>
<blockquote>Author's note:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sometime after Java version 8, Oracle introduced
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html">
Autoboxing and Unboxing</a> into the language.&nbsp; Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double, and so on. If the conversion goes the other way, this is called unboxing. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>While it is still not possible to store primitive values in a 
	Collection object, it is no longer necessary to purposely wrap the primitive 
	values in an object to store them in a collection. Therefore, you can add a 
	primitive value to a Collection object and it will be automatically 
	converted to its corresponding object wrapper type. Unless you make proper use of generics, conversion back to the original 
	primitive type is not nearly as smooth when you extract the value from the 
	collection.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The material in this eBook was written before the advent of 
Autoboxing and the existence of Autoboxing is not reflected in the text of this 
eBook.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you compile and run this code with a recent version of Java, you will 
receive a warning message that the Integer class is deprecated. You can 
eliminate that warning by adding the primitive int values directly to the 
Collection object.</blockquote>




<p>The <b>int</b> values encapsulated in the <b>Integer</b> objects are not in 
ascending order. Rather, they are added to the object in descending order. <i>
(They could be added in any order and the end result would be the same.)</i> </p>
<h3><a name="Filter_out_the_duplicates_">Filter out the duplicates </a> </h3>
<p>The <b>add</b> method 
for the <strong>TreeSet</strong> object filters out the duplicate element in order to satisfy the contract of the <b>
Collection</b> interface. </p>
<h3><a name="Notification_of_duplicates_">Notification of duplicates </a> </h3>
<p>In this case, the author didn&#39;t care what happens in the case of duplicate 
elements. If the author of the <b>fillIt</b> method does care what happens in the 
case of duplicates, she can find out when an object is a duplicate. </p>
<p>According to the contract of the <b>Collection</b> interface, the <b>add</b> 
method must return <i>true</i> if the call to the method modifies the 
contents of the object and must return <i>false</i> if the collection does not 
permit duplicates and the collection already contains the specified element. </p>
<h3><a name="Sort_the_elements_">Sort the elements </a> </h3>
<p>Even though the 
elements are passed to the <strong>add</strong> method in descending order <i>(or could be 
passed in any other order),</i> they are stored and maintained in the <b>TreeSet</b> 
object in such a way that they can later be accessed in ascending order. </p>
<h3><a name="The_TreeSet_object_is_now_populated_">The TreeSet object is now populated
</a> </h3>
<p>When the <b>fillIt</b> method returns, the <b>TreeSet</b> object contains 
four <i>(not five)</i> elements with no duplicates. Each element is a reference 
to an object of type <b>Integer</b>. Those references are maintained in such a 
way as to make them accessible in ascending order, based on the <b>int</b> 
values encapsulated in each of the <b>Integer</b> objects. </p>
<h2><a name="Get_an_Iterator_object_">Get an Iterator object </a> </h2>
<p>Returning now to the <b>doIt</b> method in the <strong>Worker</strong> 
class that was called in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a>, the statement in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> calls the <b>
iterator</b> method on the <b>TreeSet</b> object&#39;s 
reference that is stored in the reference variable of type <b>Collection</b>.</p>


<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. Get an Iterator object.
				</p>
				<pre>    Iterator iter = ref.iterator();
</pre>
</div><!--``2-->



<p>The call to the <b>iterator</b> method on any <b>Collection</b> object 
returns an instance of a class that implements the <b>Iterator</b> interface. 
The <b>Iterator</b> object can be used to traverse the collection, gaining 
access to each element in order. <i>(The concept of in order means different 
things for different kinds of collections. For a collection instantiated from 
the TreeSet class, in order means in ascending order.)</i> </p>
<h3><a name="Againdontknowdontcare_">Again, don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care
</a> </h3>
<p>Again, the author of the method that uses the <b>Collection</b> object 
doesn&#39;t need to know or care about the internal implementation of the 
collection, or the implementation of the methods of the <b>Iterator</b> object. 
They simply do what they do, and can be used for their intended purpose. </p>
<h3><a name="An_Iterator_object_acts_as_a_doorkeeper_">An Iterator object acts as a doorkeeper
</a> </h3>
<p>The <b>Iterator</b> interface declares three methods:</p>
<ul>
	<li>hasNext()</li>
	<li>next()</li>
	<li>remove()</li>
</ul>
<p>You might say that an <b>Iterator</b> object acts as a doorkeeper for the 
collection object that it represents, providing access to the contents of the 
collection in a very specific manner. </p>
<h3><a name="Traverse_the_collection">Traverse the collection</a></h3>
<p>The code fragment in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> below shows how the first two of the above 
methods can be used to</p>
<ul>
	<li>Traverse the collection, accessing each of the object&#39;s elements in 
	succession.</li>
	<li>Display the value encapsulated in the object referred to by each element.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned earlier, when the collection is an object instantiated from the
<b>TreeSet</b> class, access to the elements is provided in ascending order.</p>


<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. Traverse the 
				collection.
				</p>
				<pre>    while(iter.hasNext()){
      System.out.print(iter.next());
    }//end while loop
</pre>
</div><!--``2-->



<h3><a name="Four_elements_with_no_duplicates_">Four elements with no duplicates
</a> </h3>
<p>At this point, the <b>TreeSet</b> object contains four elements, with no 
duplicates. Each of the elements is a reference to an object of type <b>Integer</b>. 
The code in the loop in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> causes each of those elements to be accessed and 
displayed in ascending order. This causes the following text to appear on the 
screen: </p>

<h2><a name="An_editorial_opinion_">An editorial opinion </a> </h2>
<p>In my opinion, this is the kind of knowledge that a computer science student 
in a modern data structures course should be learning. This is a far departure 
from courses of the past where CS2 students were required to memorize the 
intricate details of how to implement various data structures. </p>
<h3><a name="What_kind_of_knowledge_is_needed_">What kind of knowledge is needed?
</a> </h3>
<p>Does an architect need to understand the detailed inner workings of an air

course not! </p>

cooling systems in terms of initial cost, operating cost, size, efficiency, etc.
</p>
<p>Does an audio technician need to understand the detailed inner workings of an 
electronic audio equalizer in order to construct an integrated audio system? 
Absolutely not! If that were a requirement, there would likely be very few audio

<p>However, the software designer does need to know the tradeoffs among the

<p>Modern CS2 students should be learning about the performance and operational 
differences among the different types of collections, and how to use available 
frameworks to create and use those collections. They should not be wasting their 
time learning how to reinvent them. They have more important ways to spend their 
time, and they have more important things to learn. </p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t care how the programmers at Sun implemented the <b>TreeSet</b> 
class, so long as the behavior of objects instantiated from that class meets the 
published specifications. </p>
<p>As an analogy, I also don&#39;t care how they implemented the <b>Random</b> 
class, so long as objects instantiated from the <b>Random</b> class provide the 
pseudo random values that I need in my programs. </p>
<p>I see no conceptual differences between the <b>TreeSet </b>class and the <b>
Random</b> class from a software reuse viewpoint.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I can instantiate an object of the <b>Random</b> class to produce pseudo 
	random values, without caring how those values are actually generated. 
	However, if I am working in cryptography, I might need to know how many such 
	values can be generated before the sequence repeats.</li>
	<li>I can use any of the thirty or so methods of the <b>Math</b> class to 
	produce a variety of complex mathematical values without caring about how 
	those values are actually produced. However, since many of those values are 
	approximations, I might need to know something about the quality of the 
	approximation.</li>
	<li>I can instantiate an object of the <b>TreeSet</b> class to create a 
	collection object that guarantees that the sorted set will be in ascending 
	element order, and provide log(n) time cost for the basic operations of <i>
	add</i>, <i>remove</i>, and <i>contains</i>. As long as I know that, I have 
	very little need to know exactly how the collection object is implemented.</li>

<h3><a name="Its_time_to_reinvent_the_CS2_curriculum_">Its time to reinvent the CS2 curriculum
</a> </h3>
<p>Having worked for 32 years in high-tech industry before becoming a college 
professor, I&#39;m confident that the future employers of most students share my opinion on 
this. I don&#39;t know of any employer who wants their programmers to spend time 
and dollars reinventing the classical data structures. What those employers are 
looking for is a staff of programmers who understand the tradeoffs among the 
data structures, and when it is appropriate to use each of the different 
structures. </p>
<p>It is time to reinvent the curriculum in CS2 courses by</p>
<ul>
	<li>Encouraging the understanding of techniques for software reuse.</li>
	<li>Teaching when, why, and how each of the different structures should be 
	used.</li>
	<li>Discouraging the reinvention of those structures.</li>

<h1><a name="Run_the_program">Run the program</a></h1>
<p>Okay, I will step down from my soapbox. I encourage you to copy the code from <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> and paste it into your text 
editor. Then 
compile and execute it.</p>
<p>Run the program 
and observe the results. Experiment with the code. Make changes, run the program again, and observe the results of your changes. Make certain that you 
can explain why your changes behave as they do.</p>
<h1><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter, I have provided a brief introduction to the use of the <em>Java 
Collections Framework</em>. The framework is designed to encourage you to reuse 
rather than to reinvent collections and maps. </p>
<p>A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements. </p>
<p>While some collections allow duplicate elements, others do not. Some 
collections are ordered and others are not ordered. </p>
<p>The <em>Collections Framework </em>is defined by a set of interfaces and associated 
contracts. The framework provides concrete implementations of the interfaces <i>
(classes)</i> for the most common data structures. In addition, the framework 
also provides several abstract implementations, which are designed to make it 
easier for you to create new and different concrete implementations. </p>
<p>The <b>TreeSet</b> class is a concrete implementation of the <b>SortedSet</b> 
interface. The <b>SortedSet</b> interface extends <b>Set</b>, which extends <b>
Collection</b>. Thus, a <b>TreeSet</b> object <i>is a </i><b>SortedSet</b>. Also 
it <i>is a</i> <b>Set</b>, and it <i>is a</i> <b>Collection</b>. </p>
<p>The <b>TreeSet</b> class guarantees that the sorted set will be in ascending 
element order, and provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic operations 
(<i>add</i>, <i>remove</i> and <i>contains</i>). </p>
<p><b>TreeSet</b> objects can be treated as the generic type <b>Collection</b>. 
Methods declared in the <b>Collection</b> interface can be called on a <strong>
Collection</strong> 
object without regard for the actual class from which the object was 
instantiated. <i>(This is polymorphic behavior.)</i> </p>
<p>When such methods are called, the author of the program can have confidence 
that the behavior of the method will be appropriate<b><i> </i></b>for an object 
of the class from which the object was instantiated. In my opinion, this is the 
true essence of object-oriented behavior.</p>
<h1><a name="WhatsNext">What&#39;s next</a>?</h1>
<p>This is the first chapter in a miniseries on the <em>Collection Framework</em>. 
Subsequent chapters will teach you how to use the framework for creating and 
using various types of collections and maps.</p>
<p>Once you learn how to use the framework, it is unlikely that you will need to 
reinvent classical data structures, search algorithms, or sorting algorithms, 
because those capabilities are neatly packaged within the framework.</p>
