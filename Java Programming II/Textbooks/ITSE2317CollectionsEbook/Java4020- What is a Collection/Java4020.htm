<h1><a name="Preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>This chapter is one of a series of chapters designed to teach you about 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in general and the Java Collections 
framework in particular.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to explain some of the details surrounding the use of a Java collection for creating data structures. 
The chapter also discusses the interfaces and some of the concrete implementations in the Java Collections Framework.</p>
<p>In addition to studying these chapters, I strongly recommend that you study 
the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html">
Collections Trail</a> in
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html">Oracle&#39;s Java 
Tutorials</a>. The chapters in this eBook are intended to supplement and not 
to replace those tutorials.</p>
<h1><a name="Preview">Preview</a></h1>
<p><strong>Collection</strong> is not only the name of a Java interface, it is also the term 
given to an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. </p>
<p>I will discuss the advantages of passing collections between methods as type
<b>Collection</b>. </p>
<p>I will summarize the core interfaces in the <em>Collections Framework</em> and show 
you how they are related. </p>
<p>I will very briefly discuss some of the concrete implementations of the 
interfaces that are provided by the framework.</p>
<p>And finally, I will introduce you to the three kinds of things that are part 
of a collections framework.</p>
<h1><a name="Generics">Generics</a></h1>
<p>The code in this series of chapters is written with no thought given to
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html">
Generics</a>. As a result, if you copy and compile the code, you will probably 
get warnings about <em>unchecked or unsafe operations</em>.</p>
<p>While you will ultimately need to understand how to use Generics, that is a 
very complex topic. An understanding of Generics is beyond the scope of this 
course. Therefore, for purposes of this course, you can simply ignore those 
warnings.</p>
<h1><a name="Discussion">Discussion</a></h1>
<h2><a name="What_is_a_collection">What is a collection?</a> </h2>
<p>Let&#39;s start with a little quiz. </p>
<p>What is a collection insofar as Java programming is concerned?</p>
<ul>
	<li>A. Something they gather in plates at church.</li>
	<li>B. An object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.</li>
	<li>C. The name of a Java interface.</li>
	<li>D. None of the above.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answered A, you are probably reading an article on the wrong website 
by mistake. If you answered <i>Both B and C</i>, then you are off to a good 
start on this chapter. </p>
<p><b>Collection</b> is the name of a Java interface. This interface is an 
integral part of the <em>Java Collections Framework</em>. <b>Collection</b> is 
one of two top-level interfaces in the framework. The other top-level interface 
in the framework is named <b>Map</b>. </p>
<p>According to The Java Tutorial from Oracle, a collection <i>(sometimes called 
a container)</i> is also an object that groups multiple elements into a single 
unit. </p>
<p>Typical collection objects might contain information about employees in the 
company telephone book, all the purchase orders issued during the past year, or 
the transactions occurring in a person&#39;s checking account. </p>
<h2><a name="Slightly_different_terminology_">Slightly different terminology </a>
</h2>
<p>Note that this terminology may be somewhat different from what you are 
accustomed to. For example, if you speak of your <i>coin collection,</i> you are 
probably speaking about the actual coins rather than the container that holds 
the coins. </p>
<p>This is an important distinction. The usage of the term <i>collection</i> in 
the <em>Collections Framework</em> usually refers to the container and not to the contents 
of the container. In the framework, the contents are usually referred to as the <i>
elements</i>. </p>
<h2><a name="Store_references_rather_than_objects">Store references rather than 
objects</a> </h2>
<p>The collections in the framework always store references to objects, rather 
than storing the objects themselves. One consequence of this is that primitive 
values cannot be stored in a collection without first encapsulating them in an 
object. <i>(Standard wrapper classes are provided for encapsulating all 
primitive types.)</i> </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Author's note:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sometime after Java version 8, Oracle introduced
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html">
Autoboxing and Unboxing</a> into the language.&nbsp; Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double, and so on. If the conversion goes the other way, this is called unboxing. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>While it is still not possible to store primitive values in a 
	Collection object, it is no longer necessary to purposely wrap the primitive 
	values in an object to store them in a collection. Therefore, you can add a 
	primitive value to a Collection object and it will be automatically 
	converted to its corresponding object wrapper type. Unless you make proper use of generics, conversion back to the original 
	primitive type is not nearly as smooth when you extract the value from the 
	collection.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The material in this eBook was written before the advent of 
Autoboxing and the existence of Autoboxing is not reflected in the text of this 
eBook.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="Stored_as_type_Object_">Stored as type Object </a></h2>
<p>Furthermore, the references are always stored as type <b>Object</b>. Prior to 
Java version 1.5, when you retrieved an element from a collection, you frequently needed to downcast 
it before you could gain access to the members of the object to which the 
reference refers. Version 1.5 introduced
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html">
Generics</a> into the Java programming environment, which eliminated that 
requirement, <em>(provided that you use the more complex syntax required by 
Generics)</em>.</p>
<h2><a name="Moving_data_among_methods_">Moving data among methods </a></h2>
<p>In addition to their use for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data, 
collections are also used to move data among methods. </p>
<p>One of the primary advantages of the Collections Framework is the ability to 
pass a collection to a method as the generic interface type <b>Collection</b>. 
The receiving method doesn&#39;t need to know the actual type of the object referred 
to by the incoming reference in order to call its methods. </p>
<h2><a name="Polymorphic_behavior_">Polymorphic behavior </a></h2>
<p>The receiving method can call <i>(on the reference to the Collection object)</i> 
any of the methods declared in the <b>Collection</b> interface, with confidence 
that the behavior of the method will be appropriate for the actual type of <b>
Collection</b> object involved. <i>(That is polymorphic behavior.)</i> </p>
<h2><a name="Core_collection_interfaces_">Core collection interfaces </a></h2>
<p>If you have been working with the framework, you might be inclined to think 
that all of the interfaces in the following list are members of the <i>core 
collection interfaces.</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>Collection</li>
	<li>Set</li>
	<li>List</li>
	<li>Queue</li>
	<li>Deque</li>
	<li>SortedSet</li>
	<li>Map</li>
	<li>SortedMap</li>
	<li>Iterator</li>
</ul>
<p>However, that is not the case. </p>
<p>While the <b>Iterator</b> interface is heavily used in conjunction with 
collections, according to The Java Tutorial from Oracle, it is not one of the <i>
core collection interfaces.</i> </p>
<p>The core collection interfaces identified by the Oracle book are shown below, 
with indentation showing the parent-child relationships among the 
interfaces.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Collection</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Set
		<ul>
			<li>SortedSet</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>List</li>
		<li>Queue</li>
		<li>Deque</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Map</b>
	<ul>
		<li>SortedMap</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, as mentioned earlier, <b>Collection</b> and <b>Map</b> are 
the two top-level interfaces. </p>
<p>You should probably commit the above list of interfaces and their 
relationships to memory. You might find that helpful when navigating the Oracle 
documentation. </p>
<h2><a name="Concrete_implementations_">Concrete implementations </a></h2>
<p>In addition to interfaces, the framework provides several concrete 
implementations of the interfaces defined in the framework. <i>(A concrete 
implementation is a class that implements one or more of the interfaces.)</i>
</p>
<p>Are you still awake? If so, see if you can answer the following question. </p>
<p>True or False? Each of the following classes provides an implementation of 
one of the interfaces that make up the Java Collections Framework. If False, 
which items don&#39;t belong in the list.</p>
<ul>
	<li>AbstractSet</li>
	<li>AbstractList</li>
	<li>AbstractMap</li>
	<li>HashSet</li>
	<li>TreeSet</li>
	<li>LinkedList</li>
	<li>Vector</li>
	<li>ArrayList</li>
	<li>HashMap</li>
	<li>Hashtable</li>
	<li>WeakHashMap</li>
	<li>TreeMap</li>
	<li>Iterator</li>
	<li>Attributes</li>
	<li>RenderingHints</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully your answer was False, but even so, that isn&#39;t the complete answer.
</p>
<h2><a name="Iterator_is_not_a_class_">Iterator is not a class </a></h2>
<p>To begin with, <b>Iterator</b><i> </i>is not a class. I told you that a 
couple of paragraphs back. It is an interface. Therefore, it has no place in the 
above list of classes. </p>
<h2><a name="What_about_Attributes_and_RenderingHints">What about Attributes and 
RenderingHints?</a> </h2>
<p>You may also have wondered if the classes named <b>Attributes</b> and <b>
RenderingHints</b> belong on the list. Note that I didn&#39;t restrict the above 
list to only those classes that might be considered part of the framework, so 
this was sort of a trick question. <i>(Of course you could have looked them up 
in the Oracle documentation just like I did.)</i> </p>
<p>While these two classes are not really a part of the core Java Collections 
Framework, they do implement interfaces that are part of the framework. </p>
<p>The <b>RenderingHints</b> class implements the <b>Map</b> interface, and is 
used in conjunction with the <b>Graphics2D</b> class. The <b>Attributes</b> 
class also implements the <b>Map </b>interface, </p>
<h2><a name="What_is_a_Collections_Framework">What is a Collections Framework?</a>
</h2>
<p>According to The Java Tutorial from Oracle, <i>&quot;A collections framework is a 
unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All 
collections frameworks contain three things.&quot;</i> </p>
<p>Those three things are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Interfaces</li>
	<li>Implementations</li>
	<li>Algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p>This is probably a good place to close off the discussion for this chapter. The 
next chapter (following the review chapter) will pick up at this point and provide a more in-depth discussion of 
the interfaces, implementations, and algorithms that make up the framework.</p>
<h1><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p>I started out by telling you that a collection is not only the name of a Java 
interface <i>(Collection)</i> but is also an object that groups multiple 
elements into a single unit. </p>
<p>Java <b>Collection</b> objects don&#39;t store objects or primitive values 
directly. Rather, they store references to objects. Further, all such references 
are stored as the type <b>Object</b>. However, the use of the <strong>Generics</strong> syntax 
can eliminate the need to 
downcast the reference in order to gain access to the members of the object to 
which it refers. <em>(Generics also provide other useful properties as well.)</em></p>
<p>If you need to store primitive values in a collection, you will first need to 
wrap those values in appropriate objects. Standard wrapper classes are provided 
for all the primitive types. </p>
<blockquote>Author's note:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sometime after Java version 8, Oracle introduced
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html">
Autoboxing and Unboxing</a> into the language. While it is still not possible to store primitive values in a Collection 
object, it is no longer necessary to purposely wrap the primitive values in an 
object to store them in a collection.</blockquote>
<p>Collections are not only useful for storing and retrieving data, they are 
also useful for moving data among methods. </p>
<p>Because a collection can be passed to a method as type <b>Collection</b>, all 
of the methods declared in the <b>Collection</b> interface can be called on the 
incoming reference in a polymorphic manner. </p>
<p>In addition to the interfaces defined in the Collections Framework, the 
framework also provides various concrete implementations of the interfaces for 
many of the commonly-used data structures. This makes it possible for you to 
conveniently use the framework without the requirement to define new <b>
Collection</b> classes. </p>
<p>There are eight core interfaces in the Collections Framework. Although the
<b>Iterator</b> interface is often used with collections, it is not one of the 
core interfaces. </p>
<p>I ended the chapter by telling you that there are basically three things in a 
collections framework: <em>interfaces</em>, <em>implementations</em>, and <em>algorithms</em>. 
I will have more to say about this in a future chapter.</p>
