	<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This chapter introduces you to Java programming by presenting and discussing a 
traditional <em>Hello World</em> program.</p>
<h2>Two approaches </h2>
<p>Java programs can be written and executed in at least two different ways, 
including the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Stand-alone application from the command line. </li>
	<li>Applet that runs under control of a Java-capable browser.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applets vs. applications</h2>
<p>Programming an <em>&quot;application&quot;</em> in Java is significantly different from 
programming an <em>&quot;applet.&quot;</em> Applets are designed to be downloaded and executed 
on-line under control of a browser. </p>
<p>The functionality of an applet is usually restricted in an attempt to prevent downloaded 
applets from damaging your computer or your data. No such restrictions apply to 
the functionality of a Java application.</p>
<p>As of February 2020, the use of applets may have been swept into the dustbin 
of technological history. In any event, this course does not deal with applets 
other than to provide the brief discussion given above.</p>
<h2>Class definitions</h2>
<p>All Java programs consist of one or more <strong>class</strong> definitions. 
In this course, I will often refer to the <em>primary</em> class definition for a 
Java <em>application</em> as the <em>controlling class</em>. Kjell refers to it as the 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap46/ch46_10.html#driver_class">Driver Class</a>. <em>(Also see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap46/ch46_06.html#class_definition,_syntax">Syntax of a Class Definition</a>.)</em></p>
<h2>The main method</h2>
<p>A stand-alone Java application requires a method named <strong>main</strong> 
in its <em>controlling class</em>. <em>(See Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap40/ch40_06.html">Picture of an Object</a>.)</em></p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p><a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a> shows the steps for compiling and running a 
Java application.</p>

<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_1">Figure 1.</a> How to compile and run a Java 
application. </p>
<p>Here are the steps for compiling and running a Java application, based on the 
assumption that you are running under Windows. If you are running under some 
other operating system, you will need to translate these instructions for that 
OS. </p>
<p>1. Download and install the JDK from Oracle. Also consider downloading and 
installing the documentation, which is a separate download.</p>
<p>2. Using any editor that can produce a plain text file <em>(such as Notepad 
or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a>),</em> 
create a source code file with the extension on the file name being .java This 
file contains your actual Java instructions. <em>(You can copy some sample 
programs from the early chapters in this Ebook to get started.)</em></p>
<p>3. Open a command-line window and change directory to the directory 
containing the source file. It doesn&#39;t really matter which directory the source 
file is in, but I normally put my Java files in a directory all their own. </p>
<p>4. Assume that the name of the file is <em><strong>joe.java</strong></em>, 
just to have something definitive to refer to. </p>
<p>5. To compile the file, enter the following command at the prompt: </p>
<pre>javac -cp .; joe.java</pre>
<p>This assumes that you chose to set the path in a semi-permanent way when you 
installed the JDK. An earlier chapter explained how to set the path temporarily. 
That chapter also explained how to use a batch file to execute the required 
commands as an alternative to entering them manually at the command prompt.</p>
	<p>In case you are curious about the terms "-cp .;" above, open a command 
	line window and enter the javac command. Among other things, the will see 
	something similar to the following:</p>
	<pre> --class-path &lt;path&gt;, -classpath &lt;path&gt;, -cp &lt;path&gt;
       Specify where to find user class files and annotation processors</pre>
	<p>The term "-cp .;" tells the compiler to search the current folder for 
	class files before searching elsewhere on the computer. Although this isn't 
	required, it can prove to be very useful in some circumstances.</p>
<p>6. Correct any compiler errors that show up. Once you have corrected all 
compiler errors, the <strong>javac</strong> program will execute and return 
immediately to the prompt with no output. At that point, the directory should 
also contain a file named <em><strong>joe.class</strong></em> and possibly some 
other files with a .class extension as well. These are the compiled Java files.</p>
<p>7. To run the program, enter the following command: </p>
<pre>java -cp .; joe</pre>
<p>Once again, see the discussion above regarding setting the path and using a 
batch file.</p>
<p>8. If your program produces the correct output, congratulations. You have 
written, compiled, and executed a Java application. If not, you will need to 
determine why not.</p></div>



<h1><a name="The_Java_version_of_Hello_World">The Java version of Hello World</a></h1>
<h2>The class file</h2>
<p>Compiled Java programs are stored in <em>&quot;bytecode&quot;</em> form <em>
(see Kjell <a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap05/ch05_03.html">
Bytecodes</a>)</em> in a file with an 
extension of <strong>.class</strong> where the name of the file is the same as 
the name of the <em>controlling class</em> <em>(or other class)</em> in the 
program. </p>
<h2>The main method is static</h2>
<p><em>(Also see Kjell
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap40/ch40_12.html#static">Static</a> and Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap40/ch40_13.html#static_method">Static Methods.</a>)</em></p>
<p>The <strong>main</strong> method in the controlling class of an application 
must be <em>static</em>, which results in <strong>main </strong>being a <em>
class</em> method. </p>
<p><em>Class</em> methods can be called without a requirement to instantiate 
<em>(create an instance of)</em> an object of the class. <em>(See Kjell 
instantiation <a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap40/ch40_07.html">
here</a>.)</em></p>
<p>When a Java application is started, the <em>Java Virtual Machine</em> <em>(see Kjell <a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap05/ch05_04.html">Java 
Virtual Machine</a>) or 
JVM (an executable file named java.exe)</em> finds and calls the
<strong>main</strong> method in the class whose name matches the name of the 
class file specified on the command line. </p>
<h2>Running an application</h2>
<p>For example, to start the JVM and run a Java application named
<strong>hello1</strong>, a command such as the following would be executed at the operating system prompt: </p>
<pre>java -cp .; hello1</pre>
<p>This command instructs the operating system to start the<em>
</em>JVM, and then instructs the 
JVM to find and execute the java application stored in the file named<strong> 
hello1.class</strong>. <em>(Note that the .class extension is not included in 
the command.)</em></p>
<p>This sample program is a Java application named <strong>hello1.java</strong>. When compiled, it produces a class file named <strong>hello1.class</strong>. When the program is run, the JVM calls the <strong>main</strong> method defined in the
<em>controlling class</em>. The <strong>main</strong> method is a <em>class</em> 
or static method.
<em>Class</em> (static) methods can be called without a requirement to instantiate 
an object of the class.</p>
<p>The program displays the following words on the screen:</p>
<pre>Hello World</pre>
<h1><a name="Interesting_code_fragments">Interesting code fragments</a></h1>
<p>I will explain this program code in fragments. A complete listing of the 
program is provided in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a>.</p>
	<p>The code fragment in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> shows the first line 
	of the class definition for the controlling class named <strong>hello1</strong>. 
	<em>(I will discuss class

	<p>The fragment in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> causes the following 
	text to be 
	displayed on the command-line screen. </p>
<pre>
Hello
Java World
</pre>
<p>The statement in <a href="#Listing_3">
	Listing 3</a> is an extremely powerful statement from an object-oriented 
programming viewpoint and you aren't expected to understand it at this point. When you 
fully understand how it 
	works, you will be well on your way to understanding the Java version of 
	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).</p>
<p>I will discuss this statement in more detail later in a future chapter.</p>
<p>However, there are a few things that you need to know now:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Every Java statement ends with a semicolon. Per 
	<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap06/ch06_05.html">Kjell</a>,
	<em>"A <strong>statement</strong> in a programming language is a command for the computer to do something. It is like a sentence of the language. A statement in Java is followed by a semicolon".</em></li>
	<li>Java statements can be broken onto multiple lines, but the breaks must occur 
at natural breaks in the syntax of the code. <em>(See Kjell 
	<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap09/ch09_09.html#statements,_split_over_several_lines">Several Lines per Statement</a>.)</em></li>
	<li>A string is a group of characters surrounded by double quotes. <em>(See 
	Kjell 
	<a href="https://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap44/ch44_02.html#String,_construction">Easy way to Construct Strings</a>.)</em></li>
	<li>A + character can be used to concatenate two strings into a single string.</li>
	<li>The \n sequence in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> is called an 
	<strong><em>escape character</em></strong>. There are several different escape characters that you 
	will learn about in a future chapter. This particular escape character 
	causes the output text to advance to the next line. Hence, it is often 
	called a <strong><em>newline sequence</em></strong>. In this case, it caused the word Java to be 
	displayed on a new line in the output text. Note that physical line breaks 
	in the output are independent of physical line breaks in the code.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="General_information">General information</a></h1>
<p>This program illustrates several general aspects of Java programming.</p>
<h2>Overall skeleton of java program</h2>
<p>The overall skeleton of any Java program consists of one or more class 
definitions.</p>
<p>All methods and variables must be defined inside a <strong>class</strong> 
definition. There can be no freestanding methods or global variables. </p>
<h2>File names and extensions</h2>
<p>The name of the <em>controlling class</em> should be the same as the name of 
the source file that contains it. </p>
<p>Files containing source code in Java have an extension of <em>java</em>. </p>
<h2>The main method</h2>
<p>The controlling class definition for an application must 
contain the <strong>main</strong> method. </p>
<h2>The primary class file</h2>
<p>The file produced by compiling the file containing the controlling class has the 
same name as the controlling class, and has an extension of <strong>class</strong>.</p>
<h2>Many class files may be produced</h2>
<p>The java compiler produces a separate file for every class
definition contained in an application, even if two or more 
class<strong>
</strong>definitions are contained in the same source file. </p>
<p>Thus, the compilation of a large application can produce many different <em>
class</em> files. </p>
<h2>What are jar files?</h2>
<p>A feature known as a <em>jar</em> file can be used to consolidate those 
class files into a single file for more compact storage, distribution, and 
transmission. Such a file has an extension of <strong>.jar</strong>. <em>(A jar 
file is similar to a zip file except that it is specialized for use with Java 
programs.)</em> This course does not deal directly with jar files beyond this 
brief description.</p>
<h2>The main method is static</h2>
<p>The controlling class for a Java application must contain a 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap40/ch40_12.html#static">static</a> 
method named <strong>main</strong>. <em>(See Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap06/ch06_04.html">Between the Braces</a>.)</em></p>
<p>When you run the application using the JVM, you specify the name 
of the <em>class </em>file that you want to run. <em>(See Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap06/ch06_06.html">Running a Java Program (Review)</a>.)</em></p>
<p>The JVM then calls the <strong>main</strong> method defined in the
<em>class </em>file having that name. This is possible because a <em>class 
(static) method</em> can be called without a requirement to instantiate an object of the 
class. </p>
<p>The <strong>main</strong> method defined in that class
definition controls the flow of the program.</p>

/*File hello1.java Copyright, R.G.Baldwin
This is a Java application program .

When compiled, this program produces the class named:

hello1.class

When the Java interpreter is called on the application's
controlling class using the following statement at the
command line:

java hello1

the interpreter starts the program by calling the main
method defined in the controlling class. The main method is
a class method which can be called without the requirement
to instantiate an object of the class.

The program displays the following words on the screen:

Hello 
Java World

*********************************************************/
class hello1 { //define the controlling class
  //define main method
  public static void main(String[] args){
    //display text string
    System.out.println("Hello\n" + "Java " +
