	<p><strong>Extending a class</strong></p>
<p>This chapter shows you how to extend an existing class to create a new class. The new class is the blueprint for a new type. 
Before continuing with this chapter, I recommend that you review Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap80/ch80_01.html">CHAPTER 80 — Inheritance</a> through 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap82/ch82_01.html">CHAPTER 82 — More About Polymorphism</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance and code reuse</strong></p>
<p>The existing class is often called the <em>superclass</em> and the new class is often called the 
<em>subclass</em>. This is the mechanism for class inheritance in Java. Inheritance provides a formal mechanism for code reuse.</p>
<p>The subclass inherits all of the variables and all of the methods defined in the superclass.</p>
<p><strong>Car radios with tape players</strong></p>
<p>A class from a previous chapter <em>(whose objects represent car radios)</em> is extended to define a new class, whose objects represent expanded car radios that contain tape players. 
<em>(Yes, at one point in history, car radios did contain tape players.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sending messages to the object</strong></p>
<p>Objects of the new class know how to respond to messages for inserting, playing, and removing a tape, in addition to those messages that are appropriate for objects of the original Radio class. </p>
	<h1 class="auto-style2"><a name="Discussion_and_sample_code">Discussion and sample code</a></h1>
	<p><strong>The three pillars of OOP</strong></p>
<p>In an earlier chapter, I explained that most books on OOP will tell you that in order to understand OOP, you must understand the following three concepts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Encapsulation</li>
	<li>Inheritance</li>
	<li>Polymorphism</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree with that assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong></p>
<p>The first chapter in this series provided an explanation of encapsulation.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong></p>
<p>This chapter <em>(and some chapters to follow)</em> will provide an explanation of inheritance. I will use another simple program to explain the concept of inheritance. </p>
	<p><strong>Polymorphism</strong></p>
<p>Polymorphism is the most complex of the three, and will be explained in future chapters.</p>
<p><strong>A new data type</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you define a class in Java, you cause a new data type to become available to the program. Therefore, whenever you need a new data type, you can define a new class to make that type available.</p>
<p><strong>Extending a class</strong></p>
<p>Defining a new class <em>(to create a new type)</em> can involve a lot of effort 
if the class is complex. Sometimes you have an option that can greatly reduce the effort required to create your new type. If a class 
<em>(type)</em> already exists that is close to what you need, you can often extend that class to produce a new class that is closer to what you need.</p>
<p>In many cases, this will require much less effort than that required to start from scratch and define a new class to establish a new type.

The ability to extend one class into another new class is the <em>essence of inheritance</em>. 
It is also the mechanism that leads to Java being described as an extensible 
programming language.</p>
	<p>According to the current jargon, the new class is called the <em>subclass</em> and the class that is extended is called the 
	<em>superclass</em>.</p>
<p>Although not explicitly demonstrated in this chapter, whenever you declare a 
reference variable whose type is defined by a class, that variable can be used 
to store references to objects instantiated from that class or instantiated from 
any subclass of that class. Furthermore, that reference can be used to call 
methods defined in or inherited into that class with no requirement for a cast. 
If the method is defined in that class and overridden in the subclass, and if 
the object is actually of the subclass type, the overridden version will be 
executed. This is polymorphism. </p>
<p><strong>What is inherited?</strong></p>
<p>The subclass inherits all of the variables and all of the methods defined in 
<em>(or inherited into)</em> the superclass, almost as if you had completely defined the new class from scratch, and had reproduced all of the code already defined in the existing superclasses.</p>
<p><strong>Code reuse</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, inheritance often makes it possible to define a new class with a minimum requirement to write new code by formally reusing the code that was previously written into the superclasses.

Sometimes you can get by with simply extending the existing class.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, it is also necessary to make changes to the existing class to improve its ability to be extended in a meaningful way. 
<em>(That is the case with the sample program discussed in this chapter, but the next chapter will show you how to avoid that issue.)</em> It all depends on how the existing class was designed in the first place. 
Ideally the original design of the class will be such that modification of the 
original class is not necessary.</p>
	<p><strong>The Radio class</strong></p>
	<p>A previous program defined a class named <strong>Radio</strong>. Objects instantiated from the 
	<strong>Radio</strong> class <em>(see the previous chapters for a discussion of instantiating objects)
	</em>were intended to simulate car radios. <em>(Note that the car radios simulated by objects of the 
	<strong>Radio</strong> class didn't have built-in tape players.)</em></p>
<p><strong>The Combo class</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, I will use inheritance to extend the <strong>Radio</strong> class into a new class named 
<strong>Combo</strong>. Objects instantiated from the <strong>Combo</strong> class are intended to simulate car radios with a built-in tape player.</p>
<p>A complete listing of the new program is shown in <a href="#Listing_9">Listing 9</a> near the end of the chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Will discuss in fragments</strong></p>
<p>As usual, I will discuss this program in fragments. I will begin my discussion with the definition of the new class named 
<strong>Combo</strong>. Then I will come back and discuss the class named 
<strong>Radio</strong> and the driver class named <strong>Radio02</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>The combo class</strong></p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> shows the beginning of the class named 
<strong>Combo</strong>.</p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. Beginning of the Combo 
				class.

				<pre>class Combo extends Radio{
  
  public Combo(){//constructor
    System.out.println(
           &quot;Combo object constructed&quot;);
  }//end constructor</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>Two new items</strong></p>
<p>There are two new items in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> that you did not see in the code in the previous chapters.</p>
<p><strong>Combo extends Radio</strong></p>
<p>First, the class named <strong>Combo</strong> <strong><em>extends</em></strong> the class named <strong>Radio</strong>. This means that an object instantiated from the 
<strong>Combo</strong> class will contain all of the variables and all the methods defined in the 
<strong>Combo</strong> class, plus all the variables and methods defined in the 
<strong>Radio</strong> class, and its superclasses. <em>(The variables and methods of the superclass are inherited into the subclass.)</em></p>
<p><strong>An explicit constructor</strong></p>
<p>Second, the class named <strong>Combo</strong> defines an explicit constructor.</p>
<p><strong>Defining a constructor is optional</strong></p>
<p>When defining a new class, it is not necessary to define a constructor. If you don't define a constructor, a default constructor will be provided automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Why define a constructor?</strong></p>
<p>The intended purpose of a constructor is to initialize the instance variables belonging to the new object. However, constructors can do other things as well. In this case, I used an explicit constructor to display a message when the object is instantiated from the class named 
<strong>Combo</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Brief discussion of constructors</strong></p>
<p>I'm not going to discuss constructors in detail at this point. However, I will give you a few rules regarding constructors.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Constructors <em>(like methods)</em> can be overloaded. <em>(I will explain what overloading means in a subsequent chapter.)</em></li>
	<li>The names of constructors must match the names of the classes in which they are defined.</li>
	<li>A constructor signature never indicates a return type <em>(such as void or double)</em>.</li>
	<li>The code in a constructor never contains a return statement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instance methods</strong></p>
<p>The new class named <strong>Combo</strong> defines three instance methods, each of which has to do with the handling of tape in the tape player:</p>
<ul>
	<li>insertTape</li>
	<li>removeTape</li>
	<li>playTape</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(If you feel ambitious, you could upgrade this class even further to add features such as rewind, fast forward, pause, etc.).</em></p>
<p><strong>The insertTape method</strong></p>
<p>The entire method named <strong>insertTape</strong> is shown in 
<a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. This is the method that is used to simulate the insertion of a tape by the user. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. The insertTape method.

				<pre>  public void insertTape(){
    System.out.println(&quot;Insert Tape&quot;);
    tapeIn = true;
    System.out.println(&quot;  Tape is in&quot;);
    System.out.println(
                     &quot;  Radio is off&quot;);
  }//end insertTape method</pre>
</div>
	<p>The most significant thing about the code in  
<a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> is the assignment of the <strong>true</strong> value to the 
	<strong>boolean</strong> variable named <strong>tapeIn</strong>. Other than setting the value of the 
	<strong>tapeIn</strong> variable to <strong>true</strong>, the code in  
<a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> simply prints some messages to indicate what is going on.</p>
<p><strong>What is tapeIn used for?</strong></p>
<p>As you will see shortly, the value of the variable named <strong>tapeIn</strong> is used to determine if it is possible to play the tape or to play the radio.</p>
<p>According to that logic:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If <strong>tapeIn</strong> is true, it is possible to play the tape but it is not possible to play the radio.</li>
	<li>If <strong>tapeIn</strong> is false, it is possible to play the radio, but it is not possible to play the tape.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>tapeIn is not declared in the Combo class</strong></p>
<p>It is also worthy of note that in this version of the program, the variable named
<strong>tapeIn</strong> is not declared in the <strong>Combo</strong> class <em>(this will change in the next chapter where the program uses method overriding)</em>. Rather, this variable is inherited from the 
<strong>Radio</strong> class that is extended by the <strong>Combo</strong> class.</p>
<p><strong>The removeTape method</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>removeTape</strong> method of the <strong>Combo</strong> class is shown in 
<a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. Its behavior is pretty much the reverse of the 
<strong>insertTape</strong> method, so I won't discuss it further. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. The removeTape method.

				<pre>  public void removeTape(){
    System.out.println(&quot;Remove Tape&quot;);
    tapeIn = false;
    System.out.println(
                      &quot;  Tape is out&quot;);
    System.out.println(
                      &quot;  Radio is on&quot;);
  }//end removeTape method\</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>The playTape method</strong></p>
<p><a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> shows the method named <strong>playTape</strong> defined in the new 
<strong>Combo</strong> class. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. The playTape method
.

				<pre>public void playTape(){
    System.out.println("Play Tape");
    if(!tapeIn){//tapeIn is false
      System.out.println(
            "  Insert the tape first");
    }else{//tapeIn is true
      System.out.println(
                  "  Tape is playing");
    }//end if/else
  }//end playTape</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>Confirm that the tape is ready</strong></p>
<p>Calling the method named <strong>playTape</strong> can be thought of as sending a message to the 
<strong>Combo</strong> object asking it to play the tape. The code in the 
<strong>playTape</strong> method checks to confirm that the value stored in the 
<strong>tapeIn</strong> variable is <strong>true</strong> before executing the request to play the tape.</p>
<p>If <strong>tapeIn</strong> is <strong>false</strong>, an error message is displayed advising the user to insert the tape first.</p>
<p>If <strong>tapeIn</strong> is <strong>true</strong>, the method prints a message indicating that the tape is playing.</p>
<p><strong>Modified Radio class</strong></p>
<p><a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> shows the definition of the modified version of the class named 
<strong>Radio</strong>.</p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. Modified Radio class.
				<pre>class Radio{
  protected double[] stationNumber = 
                         new double[5];
  protected boolean tapeIn = false;
  //---------------------------------//
  
  public void setStationNumber(
                int index,double freq){
    stationNumber[index] = freq;
    System.out.println(&quot;Button &quot; 
              + index + &quot; programmed&quot;);
  }//end method setStationNumber
  //---------------------------------//
  
  public void playStation(int index){
    System.out.println(&quot;Play Radio&quot;);
    if(!tapeIn){//tapeIn is false
      System.out.println(
          &quot;  Playing the station at &quot; 
               + stationNumber[index]
               + &quot; Mhz&quot;);
    }else{//tapeIn is true
      System.out.println(
            &quot;  Remove the tape first&quot;);
    }//end if/else
  }//end method playStation
  
}//end class Radio</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>Tape status</strong></p>
<p>The first significant change that was made to the class named <strong>Radio</strong> is shown in 
<a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> below. </p>
	
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_6">Listing 6</a>. Tape status.
				<pre>  protected boolean tapeIn = false;</pre>
</div>
	<p>The statement in  
<a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> declares and initializes a new instance variable named 
	<strong>tapeIn</strong>. As explained earlier, this instance variable is used to indicate whether or not a tape is inserted. 
	<em>(The Combo class inherits this variable.)</em></p>
<p>Earlier in this chapter, I explained how the <strong>playTape</strong> method of the 
<strong>Combo</strong> class uses this value to determine whether or not to attempt to play a tape.</p>
<p><strong>Change to the playStation method</strong></p>
<p>The significant change that was made to the method named <strong>playStation</strong> of the 
<strong>Radio</strong> class is shown in <a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> below. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_7">Listing 7</a>. Change to the playStation method.
				<pre>    if(!tapeIn){//tapeIn is false
      System.out.println(
          &quot;  Playing the station at &quot; 
               + stationNumber[index]
               + &quot; Mhz&quot;);
    }else{//tapeIn is true
      System.out.println(
            &quot;  Remove the tape first&quot;);
    }//end if/else</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>Check the tape status</strong></p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> uses <strong>tapeIn</strong> to check the tape status before attempting to tune the radio station and play the radio. If a tape is inserted, this method simply displays an error message instructing the user to remove the tape first.</p>
<p><strong>So, what's the big deal with inheritance?</strong></p>
<p>The fact that it was necessary for me to make changes to the class named 
<strong>Radio</strong> greatly reduced the benefit of inheritance in this case. However, even in this case, the use of inheritance eliminated the need for me to define a new class that reproduces all of the code in the class named 
<strong>Radio</strong>.</p>
<p><em>(In the next chapter (following the review chapter) I will explain the process of overriding methods. I will show you how to use method overriding to accomplish these same purposes by extending the 
<strong>Radio</strong> class, without any requirement to modify the code in the 
<strong>Radio</strong> class. That will be a much better illustration of the benefits of inheritance.)</em></p>
<p><strong>The driver class</strong></p>
<p>The new driver class named <strong>Radio02</strong> is shown in 
<a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a>. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_8">Listing 8</a>. The class named Radio02.
				<pre>public class Radio02{
  //This class simulates the 
  // manufacturer and the human user
  public static void main(
                        String[] args){
    Combo myObjRef = new Combo();
    myObjRef.setStationNumber(3,93.5);
    myObjRef.playStation(3);
    myObjRef.insertTape();
    myObjRef.playStation(3);
    myObjRef.removeTape();
    myObjRef.playStation(3);
    myObjRef.playTape();
    myObjRef.insertTape();
    myObjRef.playTape();
    myObjRef.removeTape();
    myObjRef.playStation(3);
  }//end main
}//end class Radio02</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>New object of the Combo class</strong></p>
<p>The most significant change in this class <em>(relative to the driver class named
</em><strong><em>Radio01</em></strong><em> in a previous chapter)</em> is the statement that instantiates a new object of the 
<strong>Combo</strong> class <em>(instead of the Radio class)</em>.</p>
<p>All of the other new code in  
<a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> is used to send messages to the new object in order to exercise its behavior. </p>
	<p><strong>Program output</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Combo</strong> object responds to those messages by producing the 
screen output shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
<div class="a"><a name="Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. Program output.

	<p><strong>An exercise for the student</strong></p>
<p>As the old saying goes, I will leave it as an exercise for the student to 
correlate the messages in <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> with the output 
shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
	<h1 class="style1"><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p>Extending an existing class often provides an easy way to create a new type. This is primarily true when an existing class creates a type whose features are close to, but not identical to the features needed in the new type.</p>
<p>When an existing class is extended to define a new class, the existing class is often called the 
<em>superclass</em> and the new class is often called the <em>subclass</em>.</p>
<p>The subclass inherits all of the variables and all of the methods defined in the superclass and its superclasses.</p>
<p>Although not explicitly demonstrated in this chapter, whenever you declare a 
reference variable whose type is defined by a class, that variable can be used 
to store references to objects instantiated from that class or instantiated from 
any subclass of that class. Furthermore, that reference can be used to call 
methods defined in or inherited into that class with no requirement for a cast. 
If the method is defined in that class and overridden in the subclass, and if 
the object is actually of the subclass type, the overridden version will be 
executed. This is polymorphism. </p>
<p>Inheritance provides a formal mechanism for code reuse.</p>
<p>This chapter modifies slightly, and then extends the <strong>Radio</strong> class from a previous chapter to define a new class named 
<strong>Combo</strong>. Objects of the <strong>Combo</strong> class simulate car radios that contain tape players. Objects of the 
<strong>Combo</strong> class know how to respond to messages for inserting, playing, and removing a tape, in addition to those messages appropriate for an object of the 
<strong>Radio</strong> class.</p>
<p>The changes that were required in the definition of the <strong>Radio</strong> class provide for the fact that it is not possible to play a radio station and to play a tape at the same time. This change was necessary because the original designer of the 
<strong>Radio</strong> class <em>(this author)</em> didn't design that class with the idea of extending it to include a tape player. This points out the importance of thinking ahead when defining a new class. </p>
<h1 class="style1"><a name="Whats_next">What&#39;s next?</a></h1>
<p>In the next chapter (following the review chapter) I will show you how to use <em>method overriding</em> to cause the behavior of a method inherited into a subclass to be appropriate for an object instantiated from the subclass.</p>
<p>I will also show you how to use method overriding to eliminate the above requirement to modify the 
<strong>Radio</strong> class before extending it. </p>
