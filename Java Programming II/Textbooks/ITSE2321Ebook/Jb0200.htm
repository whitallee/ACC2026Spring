<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
<h2>The first step</h2>
<p>The first step in learning to use a new programming language 
is usually to learn the foundation concepts such as </p>
<ul>
	<li>variables</li>
	<li>types</li>
	<li>expressions</li>
	<li>flow-of-control, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>This and several future chapters 
concentrate on that foundation.</p>
<h2>A sample program</h2>
<p>The chapter begins with a sample Java program named <strong>simple1</strong>. The user is 
asked to enter some text and to terminate with the # character.</p>
<p><em>(This program contains a lot of code that you are not yet prepared to 
understand. For the time being, just concentrate on the use of variables in the 
program. You will learn about the other aspects of the program in future 
chapters.)</em></p>
<p>The program 
loops, saving individual input characters until encountering the # character. When it 
encounters the # character, it terminates and displays the character entered 
immediately prior to the # character.</p>
<h1><a name="samplejavaprogram"></a>Sample 
program named simple1</h1>
<p>A complete listing of the program named <strong>simple1</strong> is provided in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. 
Discussions of selected portions of the 
program are presented later in the chapter.</p>

displays the character which was entered before the #.

<h2><a name="discussionofsampleprograms"></a>Discussion of the simple1 program</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>I will use the program shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 
1</a> to 
discuss several important aspects of the structure of a Java program. I will also provide 
two additional sample programs that illustrate specific points not illustrated in 
the above program later in this chapter. </p>
<h1><a name="variables"></a>Variables</h1>








				<h2>What is a variable?
				</h2>
				<p>Variables are used in a Java program to contain data that may 
				change during the execution of the program. According to
				<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap09/ch09_02.html">
				Kjell</a>, a variable is "<span class="highlightred">a named 
				location in main memory which uses a particular data type to 
				hold a value.</span>"</p>
	<h2>Declaring a variable</h2>
<p>To use a variable, you must first notify the compiler of the <em>name</em> and the
<em>type</em> of the variable. This is known as <em>declaring a variable (see 
Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap09/ch09_03.html#declaration">Declaration of a Variable</a>)</em>. </p>
<p>The syntax for declaring a variable is to precede the <em>name</em> of the variable 
with the <em>name of the type (see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap09/ch09_02.html">Variables</a>)</em> of the variable as shown by the code in
<a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. It is also possible <em>(but not always required)</em> to initialize 
<em>(see Kjell <a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap09/ch09_05.html">Syntax of Variable Declaration</a>)</em> the value stored in a variable 
in Java when it is declared as shown in
<a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. </p>





<!--``1List02-->
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. Declaring and 
				initializing two variables named ch1 and ch2.

<pre>
int ch1, ch2 = &#39;0&#39;;
</pre>

</div>
<!--``2-->
<p>The statement in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> declares two variables of type 
<strong>int</strong>, initializing the second variable <em>(ch2)</em> to the value of the zero character (0).
<em>(Note that I didn&#39;t say initialized to the value zero.)</em></p>






<div class="a">
	<p>
	<strong>Difference between zero and '0' - Unicode characters</strong></p>
	<p>The value of the zero character is not the same as the numeric value of zero, but hopefully you already knew that.</p>
	<p>As an aside, characters in Java are 16-bit entities called Unicode characters instead of 8-bit entities as is the case with many 
	earlier programming languages. The purpose is to provide many more possible characters including characters used in alphabets other than the one used in the United States.
	</p>
	<p><em>(Also see Kjell 
	<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap08/ch08_13.html#char">The char Primitive Data Type</a>.)</em></p>
</div>
	<h2>Initialization of the variable</h2>
<p>Initialization of the variable named <strong>ch2</strong> in this case was 
necessary to prevent a compiler error. Without initialization of this variable, 
the compiler would recognize and balk at the possibility that an attempt might be 
made to execute the statement shown in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> with a 
variable named <strong>ch2</strong> 
that had not been initialized</p>





<!--``1List03-->
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. Display the character.

<pre>
System.out.println(&quot;The char before the # was &quot; 
                                       + (char)ch2);
</pre>

</div>
<!--``2-->
	<h2>Error checking by the compiler</h2>
<p>The strong error-checking capability of the Java compiler would refuse to 
compile this program until that possibility was eliminated by initializing the 
variable. </p>
<h2>Using the cast operator</h2>
<p>You should also note that the contents of the variable <strong>ch2</strong> 
is being <em><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_type_casting.asp">cast</a></em> as type <strong>char</strong> in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a>.</p>
<p><em>(A cast is used to temporarily change the type of something to a different type.)</em></p>
<p>Recall that <strong>ch2</strong> is a variable of type <strong>int</strong>, 
containing the numeric value that represents a character.</p>
We want to display the character that the numeric value represents and not 
the numeric value itself. Therefore, we must cast it <em>(purposely change its 
type for the evaluation of the expression)</em>. Otherwise, we would not see the 
character on the screen. Rather, we would see the numeric value that represents 
that character.
<div class="a">
<p>					<strong>Initialization of instance variables and local variables:
					</strong></p>
					<p>As another aside, <em>member variables</em> in Java are automatically initialized to zero or the equivalent of zero. However, 
				<em>local variables</em>, of which ch2 is an example, are not automatically initialized.
				</p></div>
	<h2>Why declare the variables as type int?</h2>
<p>It was necessary to declare these variables as type <strong>int</strong> 
because the statement in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> <em>(more 
specifically, the call to the System.in.read method)</em> returns a value of 
type <strong>int</strong>.
</p>
<!--``1List04-->
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. Beginning of a while 
				loop.

<pre>
while( (ch1 = System.in.read() ) != &#39;#&#39;) ch2 = ch1;
</pre>

</div>
<!--``2-->
	<p>Java provides very strict type checking and generally refuses to compile 
	statements with type mismatches. </p>
<p><em>(There is a lot of complicated code in </em><a href="#Listing_4"><em>
Listing 4</em></a><em> that I haven&#39;t previously explained. I will explain 
that 
code later in this and future chapters.)</em></p>
<h2>Another variable declaration</h2>
<p>The program in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> also makes another variable 
declaration shown by the statement in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. </p>
<!--``1List05-->
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. Beginning of the main 
				method.
<pre>
public static void main(String[] args) //define main method
</pre>

</div>
<!--``2-->
	<h2>An array of String references</h2>
<p>In <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a>, the formal argument list of the
<strong>main</strong> method declares an argument named <strong>args</strong> <em>(first cousin to a 
variable)</em> as a reference to an array object of type <strong>String</strong>.
<em>(You may find it useful to skip ahead and read <a href="Jb0240.htm">Jb0240: Arrays and Strings</a>.) (You may 
also find it useful to read Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap60/ch60_02.html#array">Picture of an Array</a>.)</em></p>
<h2>Capturing command-line arguments in Java</h2>
<p>As you learned in an earlier chapter, this is the feature of Java that is used 
to capture arguments entered on the command line, and is required whether 
arguments are entered or not. In this case, no command-line arguments were 
entered, and the variable named <strong>args</strong> is simply ignored by the 
remainder of the program. </p>
<h2>The purpose of the type of a variable</h2>








<div class="a">
					<p>
					<strong>All variables must have a declared type</strong></p>
					<p>The type determines the set of values that can be stored in the variable and the operations that can be performed 
					by and on the variable.
					</p>
</div>
	<p>For example, the <strong>int</strong> type can only contain whole numbers
	<em>(integers)</em>. A whole host of operations are possible with an <strong>
	int</strong> variable including add, subtract, divide, etc.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2>Signed vs. unsigned variables</h2><p>Unlike C++, all variables of type 
<strong>int</strong> in Java contain signed values. In fact, with the exception 
of type <strong>char</strong>, all primitive numeric types in Java contain 
signed values. <em>(If this causes problems, there are workarounds involving 
methods of the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html">
Integer</a> class in later versions of Java.)</em></p>
<h2>Platform independence</h2>
<p>At this point in the history of Java, a variable of a specified type is 
represented exactly the same way regardless of the platform on which the 
application is being executed. </p>
<p>This is one of the features that causes compiled Java programs to be 
platform-independent. </p>
<h2><a name="Primitive_Types">Primitive 
types</a></h2>
<p>In Java, there are two major categories of data types: </p>

<ul>
	<li>primitive types </li>
	<li>reference <em>(or object)</em> types. </li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Also see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap08/ch08_04.html#primitive">Primitive Data Types</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Primitive variables contain a single value of one of the eight primitive 
types shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>.</p>
<p>Reference variables contain references to objects <em>(or null, meaning that 
they don&#39;t refer to anything)</em>. <em>(Also see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap44/ch44_04.html">The null Value</a>.)</em></p>
<h3>The eight primitive types 
in Java?</h3>

	<p>The table in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a> lists all of the primitive types in Java along with their size and format, and a brief description of 
each.</p>




<div class="a">

	<h3>The char type</h3>
<p>The <strong>char</strong> type is a 16-bit Unicode character value that has 
the possibility of representing more than 65,000 different characters. </p>
<h3>Evaluating a primitive variable</h3>
<p>A reference to the name of a primitive variable in program code evaluates to 
the value stored in the variable. In other words, when you call out the name of 
a primitive variable in your code, what you get back is the value stored in the 
variable.</p>

<h3><a name="objectorientedwrappersforprimitivetypes"></a>
Object-oriented wrappers for primitive types</h3>
<h3>Primitive types are not objects</h3>
<p>Primitive data types in Java <em>(int, double, etc.)</em> 
are not objects. This has some ramifications as to how they can be used <em>(passing 
to methods, returning from methods, etc.)</em>. </p>
<h3>The generic Object type</h3>
<p>Later on in this course of study, you will learn that much of 
the power of Java derives from the ability to deal with objects of any type as 
the generic type <strong>Object</strong>. For example, several of the standard classes in 
the API <em>(such as the <strong>Vector</strong> class)</em> are designed to work only 
with objects of type <strong>Object</strong>. </p>
<p><em>(Note that this document was originally published prior to the 
introduction of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">
Generics</a> in Java. The introduction of generics makes it 
possible to cause the <strong>Vector</strong> class to deal with objects of 
types other than <strong>Object</strong>. However, that doesn&#39;t eliminate the 
need for wrapper classes.)</em></p>
<h3>Converting primitives to objects</h3>
<p>Because it is sometimes necessary to deal with a primitive 
value as though it were an object, Java provides <em>wrapper</em> classes that 
support object-oriented functionality for Java&#39;s primitive data types. </p>
<h3>The Double wrapper class</h3>
<p>This is illustrated in the <em>(revised)</em> program shown in <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6
</a>that deals with a <strong>double</strong> 
type as an object of the class 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Double.html">Double</a>. </p>
<p><em>(Remember, Java is a case-sensitive language. Note the difference between 
the primitive <strong>double</strong> type and the class named <strong>Double</strong>.)</em></p>

evaluates to the value stored in the variable. </p>
<h3>What is a reference type?</h3>
<p>Reference types in Java are types where the name of the 
variable evaluates to a location in memory where the 
object referenced by the variable is stored. </p>

	
	





<div class="a">
					<p>
					<strong>The above statement may not really be true!</strong></p>
					<p>However, we can think of it that way. Depending on the particular JVM in use, the reference variable may 
				refer to a table in memory where the address of the object is stored. In that case the second level of indirection is handled behind the scenes and we don't have to worry about it. 

					</p>
					<p>Why would a JVM elect to implement another level of indirection? Wouldn't that make programs run more slowly?

					</p>
					<p>One reason has to do with the need to compact memory when it becomes highly fragmented. If the reference variables all refer directly to 
				memory locations containing the objects, there may be many reference variables that refer to the same object. If that object is moved for compaction purposes, then the values stored in every one of those reference variables would have to be modified. 
					</p>
					<p>However, if those reference variables all refer to a table that has one entry that specifies where the object is stored, then when the object is moved, only the value of that one entry in the table must be modified.
					</p>
					<p>Fortunately, that all takes place behind the scenes and we 
				as high-level Java programmers don&#39;t need to worry about it.</p>

	<h3>Primitive vs. reference variables</h3>
<p>We will discuss this in more detail in a future chapter. For now, suffice it 
to say that in Java, a variable is either a primitive type or a reference type, 
and cannot be both.</p>

variable</h3>

<h1><a name="scope"></a>Scope</h1>
<h2>What is the scope of a Java 
variable?</h2>
<p>The scope of a Java variable is defined by the <em>block of 
code</em> within which the variable is accessible. </p>
<p><em>(Briefly, a block of code consists of none, one, or more statements 
enclosed by a pair of matching curly 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap06/ch06_04.html">brackets</a>. 
By the way, which is correct, brackets or braces (see Kjell
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap06/ch06_19.html">Braces</a>). You decide. In any event, they 
look like this: {...})</em></p>
<p>The scope also determines when the variable is created <em>(memory 
set aside to contain the data stored in the variable)</em> and when it 
possibly becomes a candidate for destruction <em>(memory returned to the operating 
system for recycling and re-use)</em>. </p>
<h2>Scope categories</h2>
<p>The scope of a variable places it in one of the 
four categories shown in <a href="#Figure_5">Figure 5</a>.</p>
	
	

	
	

	

	
<div class="a">
					<p>
					<a name="Figure_5">Figure 5</a>. Scope categories.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>

		member variable 
	</li>

		local variable

		method parameter 

	</li>
	<li>

	</li>
</ul>
</div>
	<h3>Member variable</h3>
<p>A member variable is a member of a class <em>(class variable)</em> or a 
member of an object instantiated from that class <em>(instance variable)</em>. It must be 
declared within a class, but not within the body of a method or constructor of 
the class.</p>
<h3>Local variable</h3>
<p>A local variable is a variable declared within the body of a method or 
constructor or within a block of code contained within the body of a method or 
constructor. <em>(You will learn about constructors in a future chapter.) (Also 
see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap51/ch51_09.html#scope,_of_local_variable">Local Variables</a>.)</em></p>
<h3>Method parameters</h3>
<p>Method parameters are the formal arguments of a method. Method parameters are 
used to pass values into and out of methods. The scope of a method parameter is 
the entire method for which it is a parameter. <em>(Also see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap51/ch51_05.html#scope,_of_formal_parameter">Scope of a Formal Parameter</a>.)</em></p>
<h3>Exception handler parameters</h3>
<p>Exception handler parameters are arguments to exception handlers. 
Exception handlers will be discussed in a future chapter. </p>
<h3>Illustrating different types of variables in Java</h3>
<p>The Java program shown in <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> illustrates </p>
<ul>
	<li>member variables <em>(class and instance)</em>, </li>
	<li>local variables, and </li>
	<li>method parameters. </li>
</ul>
<p>An illustration of exception handler parameters will be deferred until 
exception handlers are discussed in a future chapter. </p>

	<h3>Declaration of local variables</h3>
<p>In Java, local variables are declared within the body of a method <em>(or 
constructor)</em> or within a 
block of code contained within the body of a method <em>(or constructor)</em>. </p>
<h3>Scope of local variables</h3>
<p>The scope of a local variable extends from the point at which it is declared 
to the end of the block of code in which it is declared. </p>
<h3>What is a &quot;block&quot; of code?</h3>
<p>A block of code is defined by enclosing it within curly brackets as in { ... 
}. </p>
<p>
Therefore, the scope of a local variable can be the entire method, or can reduced by 
declaring it within a block of code within the method.  </p>
	
	
	
	

	
	

	

	




<div class="a">
					<p>
					<strong>Special case, scope within a for loop</strong>
</p>
					<p>Java treats the scope of a variable declared within the initialization clause of a 
				<strong>for</strong> statement to be limited to the total extent of the 
				<strong>for</strong> statement.</p>
					<p>A future chapter will explain what is meant by a <strong>for</strong> 
				statement or a <strong>for</strong> loop.</p>
