	<p>This chapter explains Exception Handling in Java. The discussion includes 
	the following topics: </p>
<ul>
	<li>What is an exception?</li>
	<li>How do you throw and catch exceptions?</li>
	<li>What do you do with an exception once you have caught it?</li>
	<li>How do you make use of the exception class hierarchy provided by the 
	Java development environment?</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter will cover many of the details having to do with exception 
handling in Java. By the end of the chapter, you should know that the use of 
exception handling is not optional in Java, and you should have a pretty good 
idea how to use exception handling in a beneficial way. </p>
	<h1 class="auto-style2"><a name="Discussion_and_sample_code">Discussion and sample code</a></h1>
	<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
<p>Stated simply, the exception-handling capability of Java makes it possible 
for you to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Monitor for exceptional conditions within your program</li>
	<li>Transfer control to special exception-handling code <i>(which you 
	design)</i> if an exceptional condition occurs</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The basic concept</b> </p>
<p>This is accomplished using the keywords: <b>try</b>, <b>catch</b>, <b>throw</b>,
<b>throws</b>, and <b>finally</b>. The basic concept is as follows: </p>
<ul>
	<li>You <b>try</b> to execute the statements contained within a block of 
	code. <i>(A block of code is a group of one or more statements surrounded by 
	curly brackets.)</i></li>
	<li>If you detect an exceptional condition within that block, you <b>throw</b> 
	an exception object of a specific type.</li>
	<li>You <b>catch</b> and process the exception object using code that you 
	have designed.</li>
	<li>You optionally execute a block of code, designated by <b>finally</b><i>,</i> 
	which needs to be executed whether or not an exception occurs. <i>(Code in 
	the <b>finally</b> block is normally used to perform some type of cleanup.)</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Exceptions in code written by others</b> </p>
<p>There are also situations where you don&#39;t write the code to <b>throw</b> the 
exception object, but an exceptional condition that occurs in code written by 
someone else transfers control to exception-handling code that you write. </p>
<p>For example, the <b>read</b> method of the <b>InputStream</b> class throws an 
exception of type <b>IOException</b> if an exception occurs while the<b> read</b> 
method is executing. In this case, you are responsible only for the code in the
<b>catch</b> block and optionally for the code in the <b>finally</b> block. </p>
<p><i>(This is the reason that you must surround the call to <b>System.in.read()</b> 
with a <b>try</b> block followed by a <b>catch</b> block, or optionally declare 
that your method <b>throws</b> an exception of type <b>IOException</b>.)</i></p>
<p><b>Exception hierarchy, an overview</b> </p>
<p>When an exceptional condition causes an exception to be <i>thrown</i>, that 
exception is represented by an object instantiated from the class named <b>
Throwable</b> or one of its subclasses. </p>
<p>Here is part of what Sun has to say about the <b>Throwable</b> class: </p>
<p><i>&quot;The <b>Throwable</b> class is the superclass of all errors and exceptions 
in the Java language. Only objects that are instances of this class (or one of 
its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or can be thrown by the 
Java <b>throw</b> statement. Similarly, only this class or one of its subclasses 
can be the argument type in a <b>catch</b> clause.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Sun goes on to say: </p>
<p><i>&quot;Instances of two subclasses, <b>Error</b> and <b>Exception</b>, are 
conventionally used to indicate that exceptional situations have occurred. 
Typically, these instances are freshly created in the context of the exceptional 
situation so as to include relevant information (such as stack trace data).&quot;</i></p>
<p><b>The Error and Exception classes</b> </p>
<p>The virtual machine and many different methods in many different classes 
throw <i>exceptions </i>and <i>errors</i>. I will have quite a lot more to say 
about the classes named <b>Error</b> and <b>Exception</b> later in this chapter.
</p>
<p><b>Defining your own exception types</b> </p>
<p>You may have concluded from the Sun quotation given above that you can define 
and <b>throw</b> exception objects of your own design, and if you did, that is a 
correct conclusion. <i>(Your new class must extend <b>Throwable</b> or one of 
its subclasses.)</i> </p>
<p><b>The difference between Error and Exception</b> </p>
<p>As mentioned above, the <b>Throwable</b> class has two subclasses: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Error</b></li>
	<li><b>Exception</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>What is an error?</b> </p>
<p>What is the difference between an <b>Error</b> and an <b>Exception</b>? 
Paraphrasing David Flanagan and his excellent series of books entitled <em>Java 
in a Nutshell</em>, an <b>Error</b> indicates that a non-recoverable error has 
occurred that should not be caught. Errors usually cause the Java virtual 
machine to display a message and exit. </p>
<p>Sun says the same thing in a slightly different way: </p>
<p><i>&quot;An <b>Error</b> is a subclass of <b>Throwable</b> that indicates serious 
problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Most such errors 
are abnormal conditions.&quot;</i></p>
<p>For example, one of the subclasses of <b>Error</b> is named <b>
VirtualMachineError</b>. This error is <i>&quot;Thrown to indicate that the Java 
Virtual Machine is broken or has run out of resources necessary for it to 
continue operating. &quot;</i> </p>
<p><b>What is an exception?</b> </p>
<p>Paraphrasing Flanagan again, an <b>Exception</b> indicates an abnormal 
condition that must be properly handled to prevent program termination. </p>
<p>Sun explains it this way: </p>
<p><i>&quot;The class <b>Exception</b> and its subclasses are a form of <b>Throwable</b> 
that indicates conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch.&quot;</i></p>
<p>As of JDK 1.4.0, there are more than fifty known subclasses of the <b>
Exception</b> class. Many of these subclasses themselves have numerous 
subclasses, so there is quite a lot of material that you need to become familiar 
with. </p>
<p><b>The RuntimeException class</b> </p>
<p>One subclass of <b>Exception</b> is the class named <b>RuntimeException</b> 
As of JDK 1.4.0, this class has about 30 subclasses, many which are further 
subclassed. The class named <b>RuntimeException</b> is a very important class.
</p>
<p><b>Unchecked exceptions</b> </p>
<p>The <b>RuntimeException</b> class, and its subclasses, are important not so 
much for what they do, but for what they don&#39;t do. I will refer to exceptions 
instantiated from <b>RuntimeException</b> and its subclasses as <i>unchecked </i>
exceptions. </p>
<p>Basically, an unchecked exception is a type of exception that you can 
optionally handle, or ignore. If you elect to ignore the possibility of an 
unchecked exception, and one occurs, your program will terminate as a result. If 
you elect to handle an unchecked exception and one occurs, the result will 
depend on the code that you have written to handle the exception. </p>
<p><b>Checked exceptions</b> </p>
<p>All exceptions instantiated from the <b>Exception</b> class, or from 
subclasses of <b>Exception</b> other than <b>RuntimeException</b> and its 
subclasses must either be: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Handled with a <b>try</b> block followed by a <b>catch</b> block, or</li>
	<li>Declared in a <b>throws</b> clause of any method that can throw them</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, checked exceptions <i>cannot be ignored</i> when you write 
the code in your methods. According to Flanagan, the exception classes in this 
category represent routine abnormal conditions that should be anticipated and 
caught to prevent program termination. </p>
<p><b>Checked by the compiler</b> </p>
<p>Your code must anticipate and either handle or declare checked exceptions. 
Otherwise, your program won&#39;t compile. <i>(These are exception types that are 
checked by the compiler.)</i> </p>
<p><b>Throwable constructors and methods</b> </p>
<p>As mentioned above, all errors and exceptions are subclasses of the <b>
Throwable</b> class. As of JDK 1.4.0, the <b>Throwable</b> class provides four 
constructors and about a dozen methods. The four constructors are shown in 
<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. Throwable constructors.


</p>


<pre>
Throwable()
Throwable(String message)
Throwable(String message,Throwable cause)
Throwable(Throwable cause)</pre>
</div>
	<p>The first two constructors have been in Java for a very long time. 
	Basically, these two constructors allow you to construct an exception object 
	with, or without a <b>String</b> message encapsulated in the object. </p>
<p><b>New to JDK 1.4</b> </p>
<p>The last two constructors are new in JDK 1.4.0. These two constructors are 
provided to support the <i>cause facility.</i> The <i>cause facility</i> is new 
in release 1.4. It is also known as the <i>
<a href="http://softwaredev.earthweb.com/java/article/0,,12082_1431531_1,00.html">
chained exception</a></i> facility. <i>(I won&#39;t cover this facility in this 
chapter. Rather, I plan to cover it in a series of future chapters.)</i> </p>
<p><b>Methods of the Throwable class</b> </p>
<p><a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a> shows some of the methods of the <b>Throwable</b> class. <i>(I 
omitted some of the methods introduced in JDK 1.4 for the reasons given above.)</i>
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_2">Figure 2</a>. Methods of the Throwable class.


							</p>


							<pre>
fillInStackTrace()
getStackTrace()
printStackTrace().
setStackTrace(StackTraceElement[] stackTrace)

getLocalizedMessage()
getMessage()
toString()</pre>

</div>
	<p><b>The StackTrace</b> </p>
<p>The first four methods in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a> deal with the <i>
StackTrace</i>. In case you are unfamiliar with the term <i>StackTrace,</i> this 
is a list of the methods executed in sequence that led to the exception. <i>
(This is what you typically see on the screen when your program aborts with a 
runtime error that hasn&#39;t been handled.)</i> </p>
<p><b>Messages</b> </p>
<p>The two methods dealing with messages provide access to a <b>String</b> 
message that may be encapsulated in the exception object. The <b>getMessage</b> 
class simply returns the message that was encapsulated when the object was 
instantiated. <i>(If no message was encapsulated, this method returns null.)</i>
</p>
<p>The <b>getLocalizedMessage</b> method is a little more complicated to use. 
According to Sun, <i>&quot;Subclasses may override this method in order to produce a 
locale-specific message.&quot;</i> </p>
<p><b>The toString method</b> </p>
<p>The <b>toString</b> method is inherited from the <b>Object</b> class and 
overridden in the exception subclass to <i>&quot;return a short description of the <b>
Throwable</b>&quot;.</i> </p>
<p><b>Inherited methods</b> </p>
<p>All exception objects inherit the methods of the <b>Throwable</b> class, 
which are listed in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>. Thus, any of these methods may be called by the 
code in the <b>catch</b> block in its attempt to successfully handle the 
exception. </p>
<p>For example, exceptions may have a message encapsulated in the exception 
object, which can be accessed using the <b>getMessage</b> method. You can use 
this to display a message describing the error or exception. </p>
<p>You can also use other methods of the <b>Throwable</b> class to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Display a stack trace showing where the exception or error occurred</li>
	<li>Produce a <b>String</b> representation of the exception object</li>
</ul>
<p><b>So, what is an exception?</b> </p>
<p>According to the online book entitled
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">The Java Tutorial</a> by 
Campione and Walrath: </p>
<p><i>&quot;The term exception is shorthand for the phrase &quot;exceptional event&quot;. It 
can be defined as follows: </i></p>
<p><i>Definition: An exception is an event that occurs 
during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of 
instructions.&quot;</i></p>
<p>When an exceptional condition occurs within a method, the method may 
instantiate an exception object and hand it off to the runtime system to deal 
with it. This is accomplished using the <b>throw</b> keyword. <i>(This is called 
throwing an exception.)</i> </p>
<p>To be useful, the exception object should probably contain information about 
the exception, including its type and the state of the program when the 
exception occurred. </p>
<p><b>Handling the exception</b> </p>
<p>At that point, the runtime system becomes responsible for finding a block of 
code designed to handle the exception. </p>
<p>The runtime system begins its search with the method in which the exception 
occurred and searches backwards through the call stack until it finds a method 
that contains an <i>appropriate</i> exception handler <i>(catch block).</i> </p>
<p>An exception handler is <i>appropriate</i> if the type of the exception 
thrown is the same as the type of exception handled by the handler, or is a 
subclass of the type of exception handled by the handler. </p>
<p>Thus, the requirement to handle an exception that has been thrown progresses 
up through the call stack until an appropriate handler is found to handle the 
exception. If no appropriate handler is found, the runtime system and the 
program terminate. </p>
<p><i>(If you have ever had a program terminate with a <b>NullPointerException</b>, 
then you know how program termination works).</i></p>
<p>According to the jargon, the exception handler that is chosen is said to <i>
catch the exception.</i> </p>
<p><b>Advantages of using exception handling</b> </p>
<p>According to Campione and Walrath, exception handling provides the following 
advantages over &quot;traditional&quot; error management techniques: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Separating Error Handling Code from &quot;Regular&quot; Code</li>
	<li>Propagating Errors Up the Call Stack</li>
	<li>Grouping Error Types and Error Differentiation</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Separating error handling code from regular code</b> </p>
<p>I don&#39;t plan to discuss these advantages in detail. Rather, I will simply 
refer you to <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">The Java 
Tutorial</a> and other good books where you can read their discussions. However, 
I will comment briefly. </p>
<p>Campione and Walrath provide a good illustration where they show how a simple 
program having about six lines of code get &quot;bloated&quot; into about 29 lines of very 
confusing code through the use of traditional error management techniques. Not 
only does the program suffer bloat, the logical flow of the original program 
gets lost in the clutter of the modified program. </p>
<p>They then show how to accomplish the same error management using exception 
handling. Although the version with exception handling contains about seventeen 
lines of code, it is orderly and easy to understand. The additional lines of 
code do not cause the original logic of the program to get lost. </p>
<p><b>You must still do the hard work</b> </p>
<p>However, the use of exception handling does not spare you from the hard work 
of detecting, reporting, and handling errors. What it does is provide a means to 
separate the details of what to do when something out-of-the-ordinary happens 
from the normal logical flow of the program code. </p>
<p><b>Propagating exceptions up the call stack</b> </p>
<p>Sometimes it is desirable to propagate exception handling up the call stack 
and let the corrective action be taken at a higher level. </p>
<p>For example, you might provide a class with methods that implement a <i>stack</i>. 
One of the methods of your class might be to <i>pop</i> an element off the 
stack. </p>
<p>What should your program do if a using program attempts to pop an element off 
an empty stack? That decision might best be left to the user of your stack 
class, and you might simply propagate the notification up to the calling method 
and let that method take the corrective action. </p>
<p><b>Grouping exception types</b> </p>
<p>When an exception is thrown, an object of one of the exception classes is 
passed as a parameter. Objects are instances of classes, and classes fall into 
an inheritance hierarchy in Java. Therefore, a natural hierarchy can be created, 
which causes exceptions to be grouped in logical ways. </p>
<p>For example, going back to the stack example, you might create an exception 
class that applies to all exceptional conditions associated with an object of 
your stack class. Then you might extend that class into other classes that 
pertain to specific exceptional conditions, such as <i>push </i>exceptions, <i>
pop </i>exceptions, and <i>initialization </i>exceptions. </p>
<p>When your code throws an exception object of a specific type, that object can 
be caught by an exception handler designed either to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Catch on the basis of a group of exceptions, or</li>
	<li>Catch on the basis of a subgroup of that group, or</li>
	<li>Catch on the basis of one of the specialized exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, an exception handler can catch exceptions of the class 
specified by the type of its parameter, or can catch exceptions of any subclass 
of the class specified by the type of its parameter. </p>
<p><b>More detailed information on exception handling</b> </p>
<p>As explained earlier, except for <b>Throwable</b> objects of type <b>Error</b> 
and for <b>Throwable.Exception</b> objects of type <b>RuntimeException</b>, Java 
programs must either <i>handle</i> or <i>declare </i>all <b>Exception </b>
objects that are thrown. Otherwise, the compiler will refuse to compile the 
program. </p>
<p>In other words, all exceptions other than those specified above are <i>
checked</i> by the compiler, and the compiler will refuse to compile the program 
if the exceptions aren&#39;t handled or declared. As a result, exceptions other than 
those specified above are often referred to as <i>checked</i> exceptions. </p>
<p><b>Catching an exception</b> </p>
<p>Just to make certain that we are using the same terminology, a method <i>
catches</i> an exception by providing an exception handler whose parameter type 
is appropriate for that type of exception object. <i>(I will more or less use 
the terms <b>catch</b> block and exception handler interchangeably.)</i> </p>
<p>The type of the parameter in the <b>catch</b> block must be the class from 
which the exception was instantiated, or a superclass of that class that resides 
somewhere between that class and the <b>Throwable</b> class in the inheritance 
hierarchy. </p>
<p><b>Declaring an exception</b> </p>
<p>If the code in a method can throw a checked exception, and the method does 
not provide an exception handler for the type of exception object thrown, the 
method must <i>declare</i> that it can throw that exception. The <b>throws</b> 
keyword is used in the method declaration to declare that it <b>throws</b> an 
exception of a particular type. </p>
<p>Any checked exception that can be thrown by a method is part of the method&#39;s 
programming interface <i>(see the <b>read</b> method of the InputStream class, 
which throws <b>IOException</b>, for example).</i> Users of a method must know 
about the exceptions that a method can throw in order to be able to handle them. 
Thus, you must declare the exceptions that the method can throw in the method 
signature. </p>
<p><b>Checked exceptions</b> </p>
<p>Checked exceptions are all exception objects instantiated from subclasses of 
the <b>Exception</b> class other than those of the <b>RuntimeException</b> 
class. </p>
<p>Exceptions of all <b>Exception </b>subclasses other than <b>RuntimeException
</b>are checked by the compiler and will result in compiler errors if they are 
neither <i>caught </i>nor <i>declared</i>. </p>
<p>You will learn how you can create your own exception classes later. Whether 
your exception objects become checked or not depends on the class that you 
extend when you define your exception class. </p>
<p><i>(If you extend a checked exception class, your new exception type will be 
a checked exception. Otherwise, it will not be a checked exception.)</i></p>
<p><b>Exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of a method</b> </p>
<p>The exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of a method include not 
only exceptions which are thrown by code written into the method, but also 
includes exceptions thrown by methods called by that method, or methods called 
by those methods, etc. </p>
<p>According to Campione and Walrath, </p>
<p><i>&quot;This ... includes any exception that can be thrown while the flow of 
control remains within the method. Thus, this ... includes both exceptions that 
are thrown directly by the method with Java&#39;s throw statement, and exceptions 
that are thrown indirectly by the method through calls to other methods.&quot;</i></p>
<p><b>Sample programs</b> </p>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to take a look at some sample code designed to deal with 
exceptions of the types delivered with the JDK. Initially I won&#39;t include 
exception classes that are designed for custom purposes. However, I will deal 
with exceptions of those types later in the chapter. </p>
<p>The first three sample programs will illustrate the successive stages of 
dealing with checked exceptions by either catching or declaring those 
exceptions. </p>
<p><b>Sample program with no exception handling code</b> </p>
<p>The first sample program shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> neither catches nor declares the
<b>InterruptedException </b>which can be thrown by the <b>sleep </b>method of 
the <b>Thread </b>class. </p>

	<p><b>The solution to the problem</b> </p>
<p>This solution to the problem is accomplished by surrounding the call to <b>
myMethod</b> with a <b>try</b> block, which is followed immediately by an <i>
appropriate </i><b>catch</b> block. In this case, an appropriate <b>catch</b> 
block is one whose parameter type is either <b>InterruptedException</b>, or a 
superclass of <b>InterruptedException</b>. </p>
<p><i>(Note, however, that the superclass cannot be higher than the <b>Throwable</b> 
class in the inheritance hierarchy.)</i></p>
<p><b>The myMethod method declares the exception</b> </p>
<p>As in the previous version, the method named <b>myMethod </b>(declares the 
exception and passes it up the call stack to the method from which it was 
called. </p>
<p><b>The main method handles the exception</b> </p>
<p>In the new version shown in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a>, the <b>main</b> method provides a <b>
try</b> block with an <i>appropriate </i><b>catch</b> block<i> </i>for dealing 
with the problem <i>(although it doesn&#39;t actually deal with it in any 
significant way). </i>This can be interpreted as follows: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Try<b> </b>to execute the code within the <b>try</b> block.</li>
	<li>If an exception occurs, search for a <b>catch</b> block that matches the 
	type of object thrown by the exception.</li>
	<li>If such a <b>catch</b> block can be found, immediately transfer control 
	to the catch block without executing any of the remaining code in the <b>try</b> 
	block. </li>
</ul>
<p> <i>(For simplicity, this program didn&#39;t have any remaining code. Some 
	later sample programs will illustrate code being skipped due to the 
	occurrence of an exception.)</i></p>
<p><b>Not a method call</b> </p>
<p>Note that this transfer of control is not a method call. It is an 
unconditional transfer of control. There is no <i>return</i> from a catch block.
</p>
<p><b>Matching catch block was found</b> </p>
<p>In this case, there was a matching <b>catch</b> block to receive control. In 
the event that an <b>InterruptedException</b> is thrown, the program would 
execute the statement within the body of the <b>catch</b> block, and then 
transfer control to the code following the final <b>catch</b> block in the group 
of <b>catch</b> blocks <i>(in this case, there was only one <b>catch</b> block).</i>
</p>
<p><b>No output is produced</b> </p>
<p>It is unlikely that you will see any output when you run this program, 
because it is unlikely that an <b>InterruptedException</b> will be thrown. <i>(I 
didn&#39;t provide any code that will cause such an exception to occur.)</i> </p>
<p><b>A sample program that throws an exception</b> </p>
<p>Now let&#39;s look at the sample program in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a>, which throws an exception 
and deals with it. This program illustrates the implementation of exception 
handling using the try/catch block structure. </p>

	<p><b>Keeping it simple</b> </p>
<p>I try to keep my sample programs as simple as possible, introducing the 
minimum amount of complexity necessary to illustrate the main point of the 
program. It is easy to write a <i>really simple</i> program that throws an 
unchecked <b>ArithmeticException</b>. Therefore, the program in
<a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> was written to throw an <b>
ArithmeticException</b>. This was accomplished by trying 
to perform an integer divide by zero. </p>
<p><b>The try/catch structure is the same ...</b> </p>
<p>It is important to note that the <i>try/catch</i> structure illustrated in
<a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> would be the same whether the exception is 
checked or unchecked. The main difference is that you are not required by the 
compiler to handle unchecked exceptions and you are required by the compiler to 
either handle or declare checked exceptions. </p>
<p><b>Throwing an ArithmeticException</b> </p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> executes a simple counting 
loop inside a <b>try</b> 
block. During each iteration, the counting loop divides the integer 6 by the 
value of the counter. When the value of the counter goes to zero, the runtime 
system tries to perform an integer divide by zero operation, which causes it to 
throw an <b>ArithmeticException</b>. </p>
<p><b>Transfer control immediately</b> </p>
<p>At that point, control is transferred directly to the <b>catch</b> block that 
follows the <b>try</b> block. This is an <i>appropriate </i><b>catch</b> block 
because the type of parameter declared for the <b>catch</b> block is <b>
ArithmeticException</b>. It matches the type of the object that is thrown. </p>
<p><i>(It would also be appropriate if the declared type of the parameter were a 
superclass of <b>ArithmeticException</b>, up to and including the class named <b>
Throwable</b>. <b>Throwable</b> is a direct subclass of <b>Object</b>. If you 
were to declare the parameter type for the <b>catch</b> block as <b>Object</b>, 
the compiler would produce an incompatible type error.)</i></p>
<p><b>Calling methods inside the catch block</b> </p>
<p>Once control enters the <b>catch</b> block, three of the methods of the <b>
Throwable</b> class are called to cause information about the situation to be 
displayed on the screen. The output produced by the program is similar to that 
shown in <a href="#Figure_5">Figure 5</a>. </p>

	<p><b>Key things to note</b> </p>
<p>The key things to note about the code in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> 
and the output in <a href="#Figure_5">Figure 5</a>are: </p>
<ul>
	<li>The code to be protected is contained in a <b>try</b> block.</li>
	<li>The <b>try</b> block is followed immediately by an appropriate <b>catch</b> 
	block.</li>
	<li>When an exception is thrown within the <b>try</b> block, control is 
	transferred immediately to the <b>catch</b> block with the matching or 
	appropriate parameter type.</li>
	<li>Although the code in the <b>catch</b> block simply displays the current 
	state of the program, it could contain code that attempts to rectify the 
	problem.</li>
	<li>Once the code in the <b>catch</b> block finishes executing, control is 
	passed to the next executable statement following the <b>catch</b> block, 
	which in this program is a print statement.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Doesn&#39;t attempt to rectify the problem</b> </p>
<p>This program doesn&#39;t attempt to show how an actual program might recover from 
an exception of this sort. However, it is clear that <i>(rather than 
experiencing automatic and unconditional termination)</i> the program remains in 
control, and in some cases, recovery might be possible. </p>
<p>This sample program illustrates <b>try</b> and <b>catch</b>. The use of <b>
finally</b>, will be discussed and illustrated later. </p>
<p><b>A nuisance problem explained</b> </p>
<p>While we are at it, I would be remiss in failing to mention a nuisance 
problem associated with exception handling. </p>
<p>As you may recall, the scope of a variable in Java is limited to the block of 
code in which it is declared. A block is determined by enclosing code within a 
pair of matching curly brackets: {...}. </p>
<p>Since a pair of curly brackets is required to define a <b>try</b> block, the 
scope of any variables or objects declared inside the <b>try</b><i> </i>block is 
limited to the <b>try</b><i> </i>block. </p>
<p>While this is not an insurmountable problem, it may require you to modify 
your programming style in ways that you find distasteful. In particular, if you 
need to access a variable both within and outside the <b>try</b> block, you must 
declare it before entering the <b>try</b> block. </p>
<p><b>The process in more detail</b> </p>
<p>Now that you have seen some sample programs to help you visualize the 
process, lets discuss the process in more detail. </p>
<p><b>The try block</b> </p>
<p>According to Campione and Walrath, </p>
<p><i>&quot;The first step in writing any exception handler is putting the Java 
statements within which an exception can occur into a try block. The try block 
is said to govern the statements enclosed within it and defines the scope of any 
exception handlers (established by subsequent catch blocks) associated with it.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Note that the terminology being used by Campione and Walrath treats the <b>
catch block</b> as the <i>&quot;exception handler&quot;</i> and treats the <b>try</b> 
block as something that precedes one or more exception handlers. I don&#39;t 
disagree with their terminology. I mention it only for the purpose of avoiding 
confusion over terminology. </p>
<p><b>The syntax of a try block</b> </p>
<p>The general syntax of a <b>try</b> block, as you saw in the previous program, 
has the keyword <b>try</b><i> </i>followed by one or more statements enclosed in 
a pair of matching curly brackets, as shown in <a href="#Figure_6">Figure 6</a>. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_6">Figure 6</a>. Syntax of a try block.


							</p>


							<pre>try{
  //java statements
}//end try block</pre>

</div>
	<p><b>Single statement and multiple exceptions</b> </p>
<p>You may have more than one statement that can throw one or more exceptions 
and you will need to deal with all of them. </p>
<p>You could put each such statement that might throw exceptions within its own
<b>try</b><i> </i>block and provide separate exception handlers for each <b>try</b> 
block. </p>
<p><i>(Note that some statements, particularly those that call other methods, 
could potentially throw many different types of exceptions.)</i></p>
<p>Thus a <b>try</b> block consisting of a single statement might require many 
different exception handlers or <b>catch</b> blocks following it. </p>
<p><b>Multiple statements and multiple exceptions</b> </p>
<p>You could put all or several of the statements that might throw exceptions 
within a single <b>try</b> block and associate multiple exception handlers with 
it. There are a number of practical issues involved here, and only you can 
decide in any particular instance which approach would be best. </p>
<p><b>The catch blocks must follow the try block</b> </p>
<p>However you decide to do it, the exception handlers associated with a <b>try</b> 
block must be placed immediately following their associated <i>try</i> block. If 
an exception occurs within the <b>try</b><i> </i>block, that exception is 
handled by the appropriate exception handler associated with the <b>try</b> 
block. If there is no appropriate exception handler associated with the <b>try</b> 
block, the system attempts to find an appropriate exception handler in the next 
method up the call stack. </p>
<p>A <b>try</b> block must be accompanied by at least one <b>catch </b>block <i>
(or one <b>finally</b> block).</i> Otherwise, a compiler error that reads 
something like <i>&#39;try&#39; without &#39;catch&#39; or &#39;finally&#39;</i> will occur. </p>
<p><b>The catch block(s)</b> </p>
<p>Continuing with what Campione and Walrath have to say: </p>
<p><i>&quot;Next, you associate exception handlers with a try block by providing one 
or more catch blocks directly after the try block.&quot;</i></p>
<p>There can be no intervening code between the end of the <b>try </b>block and 
the beginning of the first <b>catch</b><i> </i>block, and no intervening code 
between <b>catch</b> blocks. </p>
<p><b>Syntax of a catch block</b> </p>
<p>The general form of a <b>catch</b> block is shown in <a href="#Figure_7">Figure 7</a>. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_7">Figure 7</a>. Syntax of a catch block.</p>
&nbsp;<pre>catch(ThrowableObjectType paramName){
  //Java statements to handle the
  // exception
}//end catch block</pre>

</div>
	<p>The declaration for the <b>catch</b> block requires a single argument as 
	shown. The syntax for the argument declaration is the same as an argument 
	declaration for a method. </p>
<p><b>Argument type specifies type of matching exception object</b> </p>
<p>The argument type declares the type of exception object that a particular <b>
catch</b> block can handle. The type must be <b>Throwable</b>, or a subclass of 
the <b>Throwable</b> class discussed earlier. </p>
<p><b>A parameter provides the local name</b> </p>
<p>Also, as in a method declaration, there is a parameter, which is the name by 
which the handler can refer to the exception object. For example, in an earlier 
program, I used statements such as <b>e.getMessage() </b>to access an instance 
method of an exception object caught by the exception handler. In that case, the 
name of the parameter was <b>e</b>. </p>
<p>You access the instance variables and methods of exception objects the same 
way that you access the instance variables and methods of other objects. </p>
<p><b>Proper order of catch blocks</b> </p>
<p>According to Campione and Walrath: </p>
<p><i>&quot;The catch block contains a series of legal Java statements. These 
statements are executed if and when the exception handler is called. The runtime 
system calls the exception handler when the handler is the first one in the call 
stack whose type matches that of the exception thrown.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Therefore, the order of your exception handlers is very important, 
particularly if you have some handlers, which are further up the exception 
hierarchy than others. </p>
<p>Those handlers that are designed to handle exception types furthermost from 
the root of the hierarchy tree <i>(<b>Throwable</b>)</i> should be placed first 
in the list of exception handlers. </p>
<p>Otherwise, an exception handler designed to handle a specific type of object 
may be preempted by another handler whose exception type is a superclass of that 
type, if the superclass exception handler appears earlier in the list of 
exception handlers. </p>
<p><b>Catching multiple exception types with one handler</b> </p>
<p>Exception handlers that you write may be more or less specialized. In 
addition to writing handlers for very specialized exception objects, the Java 
language allows you to write general exception handlers that handle multiple 
types of exceptions. </p>
<p><strong>A hierarchy of Throwable classes</strong></p>
<p>Java exceptions are <b>Throwable</b> objects <i>(instances of the <b>
Throwable</b> class or a subclass of the <b>Throwable </b>class).</i> </p>
<p>The Java standard library contains numerous classes that are subclasses of <b>
Throwable</b> and thus build a hierarchy of <b>Throwable</b> classes. </p>
<p>According to Campione and Walrath: </p>
<p><i>&quot;Your exception handler can be written to handle any class that inherits 
from <b>Throwable</b>. If you write a handler for a &quot;leaf&quot; class (a class with 
no subclasses), you&#39;ve written a specialized handler: it will only handle 
exceptions of that specific type. If you write a handler for a &quot;node&quot; class (a 
class with subclasses), you&#39;ve written a general handler: it will handle any 
exception whose type is the node class or any of its subclasses.&quot;</i></p>
<p><b>You have a choice</b> </p>
<p>Therefore, when writing exception handlers, you have a choice. You can write 
a handler whose exception type corresponds to a node in the inheritance 
hierarchy, and it will be appropriate to <b>catch</b> exceptions of that type, 
or any subclass of that type. </p>
<p>Alternately, you can write a handler whose exception type corresponds to a <i>
leaf, </i>in which case, it will be appropriate to <b>catch</b> exceptions of 
that type only. </p>
<p>And finally, you can mix and match, writing some exception handlers whose 
type corresponds to a node, and other exception handlers whose type corresponds 
to a leaf. In all cases, however, be sure to position your exception handlers in 
reverse subclass order, with the furthermost subclass from the root appearing 
first, and the root class appearing last. </p>
<p><b>The finally block</b> </p>
<p>And finally <i>(no pun intended),</i> Campione and Walrath tell us: </p>
<p><i>&quot;Java&#39;s finally block provides a mechanism that allows your method to 
clean up after itself regardless of what happens within the try block. Use the 
finally block to close files or release other system resources.&quot;</i></p>
<p>To elaborate, the <b>finally</b> block can be used to provide a mechanism for 
cleaning up open files, etc., before allowing control to be passed to a 
different part of the program. You accomplish this by writing the cleanup code 
within a <b>finally</b> block. </p>
<p><b>Code in finally block is always executed</b> </p>
<p>It is important to remember that the runtime system always executes the code 
within the <b>finally</b> block regardless of what happens within the <b>try</b> 
block. </p>
<p>If no exceptions are thrown, none of the code in <b>catch</b> blocks is 
executed, but the code in the <b>finally</b> block is executed. </p>
<p>If an exception is thrown and the code in an exception handler is executed, 
once the execution of that code is complete, control is passed to the <b>finally</b> 
block and the code in the <b>finally</b> block is executed. </p>
<p><i>(There is one important exception to the above. If the code in the <b>
catch</b> block terminates the program by executing <b>System.exit(0)</b>, the 
code in the <b>finally</b> block will not be executed.)</i></p>
<p><b>The power of the finally block</b> </p>
<p>The sample program shown in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> illustrates the power of the <b>finally</b> 
block. </p>

another method handle them. </p>
<p>In order to pass exceptions up the call stack, you must <i>declare</i> them 
in your method signature. </p>
<p>To <i>declare</i> that a method throws one or more exceptions, you add a <b>
throws</b> clause to the method signature for the method. The <b>throws </b>
clause is composed of the <b>throws</b><i> </i>keyword followed by a 
comma-separated list of all the exceptions thrown by that method. </p>
<p>The <b>throws</b> clause goes after the method name and argument list and 
before the curly bracket that defines the scope of the method. </p>
<p><a href="#Figure_9">Figure 9</a> shows the syntax for declaring that a method
<b>throws</b> four 
different types of exceptions. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_9">Figure 9</a>. Syntax for declaring that a 
				method throws exceptions.


							</p>


							<pre>void myMethod() throws
          InterruptedException,
          MyException,
          HerException,
          UrException
{
  //method code
}//end myMethod()</pre>

</div>
	<p>Assuming that these are checked exceptions, any method calling this 
	method would be required to either handle these exception types, or continue 
	passing them up the call stack. Eventually, some method must handle them or 
	the program won&#39;t compile. </p>
<p><i>(Note however that while it might not represent good programming practice, 
it is allowable to declare that the <b>main</b> method <b>throws</b> exceptions. 
This is a way to avoid handling checked exceptions and still get your program to 
compile.)</i></p>
<p><b>The throw keyword</b> </p>
<p>Before your code can <b>catch</b> an exception, some Java code must <b>throw</b> 
one. The exception can be thrown by code that you write, or by code that you are 
using that was written by someone else. </p>
<p>Regardless of who wrote the code that throws the exception, it&#39;s always 
thrown with the Java <b>throw</b><i> </i>keyword. At least that is true for 
exceptions that are thrown by code written in the Java language. </p>
<p><i>(Exceptions such as <b>ArithmeticException</b> are also thrown by the 
runtime system, which is probably not written using Java source code.)</i></p>
<p><b>A single argument is required</b> </p>
<p>When formed into a statement, the <b>throw</b> keyword requires a single 
argument, which must be a reference to an object instantiated from the <b>
Throwable</b> class, or any subclass of the <b>Throwable</b> class. 
<a href="#Figure_10">Figure 10</a> 
shows an example of such a statement. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_10">Figure 10</a>.  Example of a throw 
				statement.</p>
&nbsp;<pre>throw new myThrowableClass("Message");</pre>

</div>
	<p>If you attempt to throw an object that is not instantiated from <b>
	Throwable</b> or one of its subclasses, the compiler will refuse to compile 
	your program. </p>
<p><b>Defining your own exception classes</b> </p>
<p>Now you know how to write exception handlers for those exception objects that 
are thrown by the runtime system, and thrown by methods in the standard class 
library. </p>
<p>It is also possible for you to define your own exception classes, and to 
cause objects of those classes to be thrown whenever an exception occurs. In 
this case, you get to decide just what constitutes an exceptional condition. </p>
<p>For example, you could write a data-processing application that processes 
integer data obtained via a TCP/IP link from another computer. If the 
specification for the program indicates that the integer value 10 should never 
be received, you could use an occurrence of the integer value 10 to cause an 
exception object of your own design to be thrown. </p>
<p><b>Choosing the exception type to throw</b> </p>
<p>Before throwing an exception, you must decide on its type. Basically, you 
have two choices in this regard: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Use an exception class written by someone else, such as the myriad of 
	exception classes defined in the Java standard library.</li>
	<li>Define an exception class of your own.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>An important question</b> </p>
<p>So, an important question is, when should you define your own exception 
classes and when should you use classes that are already available. Because this 
is only one of many design issues, I&#39;m not going to try to give you a ready 
answer to the question. However, I will refer you to
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">The Java Tutorial</a> by 
Campione and Walrath where you will find a checklist to help you make this 
decision. </p>
<p><b>Choosing a superclass to extend</b> </p>
<p>If you decide to define your own exception class, it must be a subclass of <b>
Throwable</b>. You must decide which class you will extend. </p>
<p>The two existing subclasses of <b>Throwable</b> are <b>Exception</b> and <b>
Error</b>. Given the earlier description of <b>Error</b> and its subclasses, it 
is not likely that your exceptions would fit the <b>Error</b> category. <i>(In 
concept, errors are reserved for serious hard errors that occur deep within the 
system.)</i> </p>
<p><b>Checked or unchecked exception</b> </p>
<p>Therefore, your new class should probably be a subclass of <b>Exception</b>. 
If you make it a subclass of <b>RuntimeException</b>, it won&#39;t be a checked 
exception. If you make it a subclass of <b>Exception</b>, but not a subclass of
<b>RuntimeException</b>, it will be a checked exception. </p>
<p>Only you can decide how far down the <b>Exception</b> hierarchy you want to 
go before creating a new branch of exception classes that are unique to your 
application. </p>
<p><b>Naming conventions</b> </p>
<p>Many Java programmers append the word <b>Exception</b> to the end of all 
class names that are subclasses of <b>Exception</b>, and append the word <b>
Error</b> to the end of all class names that are subclasses of <b>Error</b>. </p>
<p><b>One more sample program</b> </p>
<p>Let&#39;s wrap up this chapter with one more sample program named <b>Excep16</b>. 
We will define our own exception class in this program. Then we will <b>throw</b>,
<b>catch and</b> process an exception object instantiated from that class. </p>
<p><b>Discuss in fragments</b> </p>
<p>This program is a little longer than the previous programs, so I will break 
it down and discuss it in fragments. A complete listing of the program is shown 
in <a href="#Listing_10">Listing 10</a>. </p>
<p>The class definition shown in <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> is used to 
construct a custom exception object that encapsulates a message. Note that this 
class extends <b>Exception</b>. <i>(Therefore, it is a checked exception.)</i>
</p>
	
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_6">Listing 6</a>. The class named MyException . </p>
				<pre>class MyException extends Exception{
  MyException(String message){//constr
    super(message);
  }//end constructor
}//end MyException class</pre>
</div>
	<p>The constructor for this class receives an incoming <b>String</b> message 
	parameter and passes it to the constructor for the superclass. This makes 
	the message available for access by the <b>getMessage</b> method called in 
	the catch block. </p>
<p><b>The try block</b> </p>
<p><a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> shows the beginning of the <b>main</b> method, including the entire
<b>try</b> block </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_7">Listing 7</a>. The try block.</p>
&nbsp;<pre>class Excep16{//controlling class
  public static void main(
                        String[] args){
    try{
      for(int cnt = 0; cnt &lt; 5; cnt++){
        //Throw a custom exception, and
        // pass  message when cnt == 3
        if(cnt == 3) throw
                  new MyException(&quot;3&quot;);
        //Transfer control before
        // processing for cnt == 3
        System.out.println(
           &quot;Processing data for cnt = &quot;
                                + cnt);
      }//end for-loop
    }//end try block</pre>
</div>
	<p>The <b>main</b> method executes a <b>for</b> loop <i>(inside the <b>try</b> 
	block)</i> that guarantees that the variable named <b>cnt</b> will reach a 
	value of 3 after a couple of iterations. </p>
<p>Once during each iteration, <i>(until the value of <b>cnt</b> reaches 3)</i> 
a print statement inside the <b>for</b> loop displays the value of <b>cnt</b>. 
This results in the output shown in <a href="#Figure_11">Figure 11</a>. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_11">Figure 11</a>. Output from the for loop.


							</p>


							<pre>Processing data for cnt = 0
Processing data for cnt = 1
Processing data for cnt = 2</pre>

</div>
	<p><b>What happens when cnt equals 3?</b> </p>
<p>However, when the value of <b>cnt</b> equals 3, the <b>throw</b> statement in
<a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> is executed. This causes control to transfer 
immediately to the matching <b>catch</b> block following the <b>try</b> 
block <i>(see <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a>).</i> During this iteration, 
the print statement following the <b>throw</b> statement is not executed. 
Therefore, the output never shows a value for <b>cnt</b> greater than 2, as 
shown in <a href="#Figure_11">Figure 11</a>. </p>
<p><b>The catch block</b> </p>
<p><a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> shows a <b>catch</b> block whose type 
matches the type of exception thrown in <a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a>. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_8">Listing 8</a>. A matching catch block.</p>
&nbsp;<pre>    catch(MyException e){

                  + "get the message\n"
                     + e.getMessage());
    }//end catch block</pre>
</div>
	<p>When the <b>throw</b> statement is executed in <a href="#Listing_7">
	Listing 7</a>, control is transferred immediately to the <b>catch</b> block in <a href="#Listing_8">
	Listing 8</a>. No further code is executed within the <b>try</b> block. </p>
<p>A reference to the object instantiated as the argument to the <b>throw</b> 
keyword in <a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> is passed as a parameter to the <b>
catch</b> block. That 
reference is known locally by the name <b>e</b> inside the <b>catch</b> block.
</p>
<p><b>Using the incoming parameter</b> </p>
<p>The code in the <b>catch</b> block calls the method named <b>getMessage </b>
<i>(inherited from the <b>Throwable</b> class) </i>on the incoming parameter and 
displays that message on the screen. This produces the output shown in
<a href="#Figure_12">Figure 12</a>. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_12">Figure 12</a>. Output from the exception

	<p><b>When the catch block finishes execution ...</b> </p>
<p>When the code in the <b>catch</b> block has completed execution, control is 
transferred to the first executable statement following the <b>catch</b> block 
as shown in <a href="#Listing_9">Listing 9</a>. </p>

<p>This chapter has covered many of the details having to do with exception 
handling in Java. By now, you should know that the use of exception handling is 
not optional in Java, and you should have a pretty good idea how to use 
exception handling in a beneficial way. </p>
<p>Along the way, the discussion has included the following topics: </p>
<ul>
	<li>What is an exception?</li>
	<li>How do you throw and catch exceptions?</li>
	<li>What do you do with an exception once you have caught it?</li>
	<li>How do you make use of the exception class hierarchy provided by the 
	Java development environment?</li>
</ul>
