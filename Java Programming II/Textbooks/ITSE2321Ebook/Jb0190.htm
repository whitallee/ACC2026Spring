	<p>This chapter takes a preliminary look at the complexity of OOP by examining some 
	aspects of the  
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html">System</a> 
	and

	<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This chapter introduces you to the use of the <b>System </b>and <b>PrintStream
</b>classes in Java. This is our first introduction to the complexity that can 
accompany the <b>OOP </b>paradigm. It gets a little complicated, so you might 
need to pay special attention to the discussion. </p>
	<h1><a name="Discussion">Discussion</a></h1>
<h2>What does the main method do?</h2>
<p>The <strong>main</strong> method in the controlling <em>(driver)</em> class of a Java 
application controls the flow of the program. </p>
<p>The <strong>main</strong> method can also access other classes along with the 
variables and methods of those classes and of objects instantiated from those 
classes. </p>
<h2>The Hello1 Application</h2>
<p><a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> shows a simple Java application named
<strong>Hello1</strong>.</p>
<p><em>(By convention, the names of class definitions in Java should begin with an upper-case 
character. However, many sample programs in this Ebook do not adhere to that 
convention because they were originally written before the convention came into 
common use.)</em></p>
<!--``1List01-->
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. The program named Hello1.

<pre>
/*File Hello1.java Copyright, R.G.Baldwin
**********************************************************/
class Hello1 { //define the controlling class
  //define main method
  public static void main(String[] args){
    //display text string
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
  }//end main
}//End Hello1 class.  No semicolon at end of Java class.
</pre>

	<h2>Does this program Instantiate objects?</h2>
<p>This is a simple example that does not instantiate objects of any other 
class. </p>
<h2>Does this program access another class?</h2>
<p>However, it does access another class. It accesses the 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html">System</a> 
class that is provided with the Java development kit. <em>(The <strong>System</strong> class will 
be discussed in more detail in a future chapter.) </em></p>
<h2>The variable named <em>out</em></h2>
<p>The variable named 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#out">out</a>, referred to in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> as <strong>System.out</strong>, 
is a <em>public static final variable</em> of the <strong>System</strong> class. </p>
<p>Recall that a static variable can be accessed without a requirement to 
instantiate an object of the class. As is the case with all variables, the 
static variable must be of some specific type and in this case the type of the 
variable is <strong>PrintStream</strong>.</p>
<h2>Primitive variables vs. reference variables</h2>
<p>A class variable may be a <em>primitive variable</em>, which contains a 
primitive value, or it may be a <em>reference 
variable</em>, which contains a reference to an object. <em>(See Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap11/ch11_06.html#reference,_object">Objects are Created at Run Time</a>.)</em></p>
<p><em>(I&#39;ll have more to say about the difference between primitive 
variables and 
reference variables in a future chapter.)</em></p>
<p>The variable named <strong>out</strong> in this case is a
<em>reference variable</em> that refers to an object of another type:
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html">
PrintStream</a>. </p>
<h2>Accessing class variables</h2>
<p>You access static or class variables or methods in Java by joining the name of 
the class to the name of the variable or method with a period as shown 
<a name="below">below</a>. </p>



<div class="a">				<p>System.out

</p>
				<p>accesses the class variable named <strong>out</strong> in the Java class named 
				<strong>System</strong>.</p>
</div>	<h2>The PrintStream class</h2>
<p>Another class that is provided with the Java development kit is the 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html">PrintStream</a> 
class. A <strong>PrintStream</strong> adds functionality to another output stream, namely the ability to print representations of various data values conveniently.</p>
<h2>What does the out variable refer to?</h2>
<p>The <strong>out</strong> variable in the <strong>System</strong> class refers 
to <em>(points to)</em> an instance of the <strong>PrintStream</strong> class
<em>(a <strong>PrintStream</strong> object),</em> which is automatically 
instantiated when the <strong>System</strong> class is loaded into the 
application. </p>
<p>We will be discussing the <strong>PrintStream</strong> class along with a 
number of other classes in detail in a future chapter on input/output streams, so 
this is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion. </p>
<h2>The println method</h2>
<p>The <strong>PrintStream</strong> class has several overloaded versions of <em>instance methods</em> named 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html#println()">println</a>
<em>(see Kjell <a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap06/ch06_05.html">println()</a>)</em> that causes its argument to be displayed on the standard 
output device when it is called. <em>(Overloaded methods will be discussed in a 
later chapter. Also see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap51/ch51_16.html#overloading,_of_methods">Method Overloading</a>.)</em></p>
	<p><em>(Typically, the standard output device is the command-line window. 
	However, it is possible to redirect it to some other device when you start 
	the program. See Kjell 
	<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap70/ch70_08.html#redirection,_program_output">Redirecting Output.</a>)</em></p>
	
	<h2>Accessing an instance method</h2>
<p>The 
method named <strong>println</strong> can be accessed by joining a <strong>
PrintStream</strong> object&#39;s 
reference to the name of the method using a period. </p>
<p>Thus, <em>(assuming that the standard output device has not been redirected)</em>, the 
statement shown in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> causes the string &quot;Hello 
World&quot; <em>(without the quotation marks)</em> to be displayed in the 
command-line window.</p>
<!--``1List02-->
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. Display the string &quot;Hello 
				World&quot;.

<pre>
System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
</pre>

</div>
<!--``2-->
	<p>SUMMARY: This statement calls the <strong>println</strong> method of an object 
	instantiated from 
	the <strong>PrintStream</strong> class, which is referred to <em>(pointed to)</em> 
	by the variable named <strong>out</strong>, which is a <em>class variable</em> 
	of the <strong>System</strong> class. </p>
<p>Read the previous paragraph very carefully. As I indicated when I started this chapter, this is our first introduction to 
the complexity that can result from use of the OOP paradigm. <em>(It can get 
even more complicated.)</em> If this is not clear to you, go back 
over it and think about it until it becomes clear. </p>
	<h1><a name="A_word_about_class_variables">A word about class variables</a></h1>
<h2>How many instances of a class variable exist?</h2>
<p>The runtime system allocates memory for a class (static) variable only once no matter how many 
instances <em>(objects)</em> of the class containing the variable are instantiated. </p>
<p>All objects of the class share the same physical memory space for the class 
variable. </p>
<p>If a method in one object changes the value stored in the class variable, it 
is changed insofar as all of the objects are concerned. <em>(For the benefit of 
experienced C, C++, or Pascal programmers, this is about as 
close to a global variable as you can get in Java. If you don't know what a 
global variable is, don't worry about it.)</em></p>
<h2>Accessing a class variable</h2>
<p>You can use the name of the class to access class variables by joining the 
name of the class to the name of the variable using a period as shown
<a href="#below">earlier</a>.</p>
<p>You can also access a class variable by joining the name of a reference 
variable containing an object&#39;s reference to the name of the variable using a 
period as the joining operator.</p>
<h2>Referencing object methods via class variables</h2>
<p>Class variables are either primitive variables or reference variables. <em>
(Primitive variables contain primitive values and reference variables contain references 
to objects.)</em> </p>
<p>A referenced object may provide methods to control the behavior of the 
object. In <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>, we accessed the <strong>println</strong> method of 
an object of the <strong>PrintStream</strong> class 
referred to by the class variable named <strong>out</strong>. </p>
<h2>Instance variables and methods</h2>
<p>As a side note, in addition to class variables, Java provides <em>instance 
variables</em> <em>(see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap47/ch47_06.html#instance_variable">Filling in the Definition</a>)</em> and <em>instance methods</em>. Every instance of a class has its 
own set of instance variables. You can only access instance variables and 
instance methods through a reference to an object of the class.</p>
