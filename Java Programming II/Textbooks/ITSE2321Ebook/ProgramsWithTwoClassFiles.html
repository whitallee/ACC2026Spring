		<p class="auto-style1">Update: Java programs with two or more source code files</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Students,</p>
		<p><span class="auto-style1">Chapter </span> 
		<span style="color: #000000;" class="auto-style1"><em><strong>Jb0110: Programming 
		Fundamentals, Getting Started</strong></em></span><span class="auto-style1"> in the course Ebook 
		explains how to write, compile, and run Java programs consisting of a 
		single source code file. The purpose of this announcement is to provide 
		an example showing how to write, compile, and run Java programs 
		consisting of two or more source code files, which is the case for most 
		of the assignments in this course.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style1">One student reported that the instructions given 
		in the original version of this announcement would not work on his 
		computer. As it turned out, that student's computer apparently had an 
		invalid preset classpath installed which was preventing the sample 
		program from compiling. Those instructions have been updated in this 
		version to use the -cp switch to tell the compiler to ignore a preset 
		classpath, valid or otherwise. If you are having difficulty compiling 
		and running the sample program on your system, try using the updated 
		instructions provided below.</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Begin by creating a new empty folder named Hello02. Create a Java 
		source code file in that folder named Hello02.java containing the code 
		shown below:</p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">class Hello02{</span><br class="auto-style1" />
  <span class="auto-style1">public static void main(String[] args){</span><br class="auto-style1" />
    <span class="auto-style1">new Hello02Runner().run();</span><br class="auto-style1" />
  <span class="auto-style1">}//end main</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">}//end class</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Create another Java source code file in that folder named 
		Hello02Runner.java containing the code shown below:</p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">class Hello02Runner{</span><br class="auto-style1" />
  <span class="auto-style1">void run(){</span><br class="auto-style1" />
    <span class="auto-style1">System.out.println("Hello World from Hello02");</span><br class="auto-style1" />
  <span class="auto-style1">}//end main</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">}//end class</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Open a command line window in the folder named Hello02 and enter the 
		following command to compile the program. Note that this command uses 
		the -cp switch to tell the compiler to ignore a preset classpath and 
		search only the current folder.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">javac -cp .; Hello02.java</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">If there are no errors, the command prompt should reappear and the 
		following two files should have been created in the folder named 
		Hello02. (You may need to press the F5 key to make them visible.)</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Hello02.class<br/>
		Hello02Runner.class</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Next, enter the following command to run the 
		program. Note that this command uses the -cp switch to tell the Java 
		virtual machine to ignore a preset classpath and search only the current 
		folder.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">java -cp .; Hello02</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">The following output should appear on the command-line screen:</p>
<p class="auto-style1">Hello World from Hello02</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Note that these instructions assume that you set the path environment 
		variable when you installed the Java software. If you didn't, you will 
		need to deal with the path when entering the commands. In that case, 
		your commands would be something like the following depending on the 
		version of the Java software that was installed and where the software 
		was installed on your hard drive. (Note that the quotation marks are 
		required in the commands due to the space character in the folder name: 
		Program Files.)</p>
		<p><span class="auto-style1">"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13\bin"\javac 
		-cp .; Hello02.java</span><br class="auto-style1" />
		<span class="auto-style1">"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13\bin"\java -cp .; Hello02</span></p>
