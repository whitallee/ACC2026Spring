<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>The first step in learning to use a new programming language is usually to 
learn the foundation concepts such as variables, types, expressions, 
flow-of-control, etc. This chapter concentrates on <em>flow-of-control</em>.</p>
<h1><a name="flowofcontrol">Flow of 
control</a></h1>
<p><strong>What is flow of control?</strong></p>
<p>Java supports several different kinds of 
statements designed to alter or control the logical flow of the program. </p>
<p>The ability to alter the logical flow of the program is often referred to as 
<em>Flow of Control</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Statements that support flow of 
control</strong></p>
<p><a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a> lists the statements supported by Java 
for controlling the logical flow of the 
program. </p>

<h2><a name="thewhilestatement">The 
while statement</a></h2>
<p>We have seen the <strong>while</strong> 
statement in earlier chapters. Some of the programs in earlier chapters contained a 
<strong>while</strong> 
statement designed to control the logical flow of the program. </p>

<p><strong>Syntax of a while statement</strong></p>
<p>The general syntax of a <strong>while</strong> 
statement is shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>.</p>
<!--``1Fig002-->
<div class="a">				<p><a name="Figure_2">Figure 2</a>. Syntax of a while 
				statement.
</p>
<pre>
while (conditional expression)
  statement or compound statement;
</pre>

</div>
<p><strong>Behavior of a while statement</strong></p>
<p>The <a name="three_pillars">three pillars</a> of procedural programming are</p>
<ul>
	<li>sequence</li>
	<li>selection</li>
	<li>loop</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>while</strong> statement is commonly used to create a loop 
structure, often referred to as a <em>while loop</em>.</p>
<p>Once the <strong>while</strong> statement is encountered in the sequence of 
code, the program will continue to execute 
the statement or compound statement shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a> for as long as the conditional expression 
evaluates to true. <em>(Note that a compound statement is created by enclosing 
two or more statements inside a pair of matching curly brackets, thus creating a 
block of code as the body of the <strong>while</strong> statement or loop.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sample Java <em>while</em> statement</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>while</strong> statement shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> was extracted from a 
Java program in an earlier chapter.</p>
<!--``1List01-->
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. Sample Java while 
				statement.
</p>
<pre>
while( (ch1 = System.in.read() ) != &#39;#&#39;) 
  ch2 = ch1;
</pre>

</div><!--``2-->
<p><strong>The <em>in</em> variable of the <em>System</em> class</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>System</strong> class defines a <em>class</em> variable named 
<strong>in</strong>. Because it is a <em>class</em> variable, it can be accessed using the name 
of the <strong>System</strong> class without the requirement to instantiate an object of 
the <strong>System</strong> class. </p>
<p><strong>What the <em>in</em> variable contains</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>in</strong> variable refers to an instance of a class that 
provides a <strong>read</strong> method that returns a character from the standard 
input device <em>(typically the keyboard)</em>. </p>
<p>Therefore, the expression <strong>System.in.read()</strong> in
<a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> constitutes a call 
to the <strong>read</strong> method of the object referred to by the <strong>in</strong> variable of 
the <strong>System</strong> class. </p>
<p><strong>A <em>while</em> loop is an entry condition 
loop</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>while</strong> statement is used to form an 
<em>entry condition</em> loop. The significance of an entry condition loop is 
that the conditional expression is tested before the statements in the loop are 
executed. If it tests false initially, the statements in the loop are never 
executed.</p>
<p>The <strong>while</strong> loop shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> 
will continue reading characters from the keyboard for as long as the character 
entered is not the # character. <em>(Recall the not equal (!=) operator from an 
earlier chapter.)</em></p>

<h2><a name="theifelsestatement">The 
if-else statement</a></h2>
<p>The general syntax of an <strong>if-else</strong> statement is shown in
<a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<!--``1Fig003-->
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_3">Figure 3</a>. Syntax of an if-else statement.</p>
<pre>
if(conditional expression)
  statement or compound statement;
else //optional
  statement or compound statement; //optional
</pre>

</div>	<p>The <strong>if-else</strong> statement is the most basic of the statements used to control the logical flow 
	of a Java program. It is used to satisfy the <em>selection</em> pillar 
	mentioned <a href="#three_pillars">earlier</a>.</p>
<p>This statement will execute a specified block of code if some particular 
condition is true, and optionally, will execute a different block of code if the 
condition is not true.</p>
<p>The <strong>else</strong> clause shown in
<a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a> is optional. If it is not provided and the 
condition is not true, control simply passes to the next statement following the
<strong>If</strong> statement with none of the code in the body of the <strong>if</strong> 
statement being executed. If the condition is true, the code in the body of the
<strong>if</strong> statement is executed.</p>
<p>If the <strong>else</strong> clause is provided and the condition is true, 
the code in the body of the <strong>if</strong> clause is executed and the code in the
body of the
<strong>else</strong> clause is ignored.</p>
<p>If the <strong>else</strong> clause is provided and the condition is false, 
the code in the body of the <strong>if</strong> clause is ignored and the code in the
body of the
<strong>else</strong> clause is executed.</p>
<p>In all cases, control passes to the next statement following the <strong>
if-else</strong> statement when the code in the <strong>if-else</strong> 
statement has finished executing. In other words, this is not a loop structure.</p>
<h2><a name="theswitchcasestatement">The switch-case statement</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>switch-case</strong> statement is another implementation of the
<em>selection</em> pillar mentioned
<a href="#three_pillars">earlier</a>. The general syntax of a 
<strong>switch-case</strong> statement is shown in <a href="#Figure_4">Figure 4</a>.</p>
<!--``1Fig004-->
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_4">Figure 4</a>. Syntax of a switch-case statement.</p>
<pre>
switch(expression){
  case constant:
    //sequence of optional statements
    break; //optional
  case constant:
    //sequence of optional statements
    break; //optional
.
.
.
  default //optional
    //sequence of optional statements
}
</pre>

</div>	<p><strong>The type of the <em>expression</em></strong></p>
<p>According to the book titled <em>Java Language Reference</em>, by Mark 
Grand, the expression shown in the first line in <a href="#Figure_4">Figure 4</a> must be 
of type <strong>byte</strong>, <strong>char</strong>, <strong>short</strong>, or 
<strong>int</strong>. However, according to 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap34/ch34_14.html">Kjell</a>,</p>
<blockquote> "Starting with Java 7.0 the expression can be a String reference and the case labels can be String literals.

</blockquote>
<blockquote> Matching of the expression with the case labels is done as if by String.equals()."</blockquote>
<p><strong>The behavior of the switch-case statement</strong></p>
<p>The expression is tested against a series of <em>case</em> constants 
of the same type as the expression. If a match 
is found, the sequence of optional statements associated with that <em>case</em> is executed. </p>
<p>Execution of statements continues until the optional <strong>break</strong> is 
encountered. When <strong>break</strong> is encountered, execution of the switch 
statement is terminated and control passes to the next statement following 
the switch statement.</p>
<p>If there is no <strong>break</strong> statement, all of the statements 
following the matching case will be executed including those in cases further 
down the page.</p>
<p><strong>The optional default keyword</strong></p>
<p>If no match is found and the optional default keyword 
along with a sequence of optional statements has been provided, those statements 
will be executed. </p>
<p><strong>Labeled break</strong></p>
<p>Java also supports labeled break statements. 
This capability can be used to cause Java to exhibit different behavior when 
switch statements are nested. This will be explained more fully in a later 
section on labeled break statements. </p>

<h2><a name="theforloop">The for 
loop</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>for</strong> statement is another implementation of the <em>loop</em> 
pillar mentioned <a href="#three_pillars">earlier</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Actions of a <em>for loop</em></strong></p>
<p>The operation of a loop normally involves three actions in 
addition to executing the code in the body of the loop: </p>

<ul>
<li>Initialize a control variable. </li>
<li>Test the control variable in a conditional expression. </li>
<li>Update the control variable.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Grouping the actions</strong></p>
<p>Java provides the <strong>for</strong> loop construct that groups these 
three actions in one place.</p>
<p><strong>The syntax of a for loop</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>for</strong> loop consists of three clauses separated 
by semicolons as shown in <a href="#Figure_5">Figure 5</a>.</p>
<!--``1Fig005-->
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_5">Figure 5</a>. Syntax of a for loop.
</p>
<pre>
for (first clause; second clause; third clause)
  single or compound statement
</pre>

</div>	<p><strong>Contents of the clauses</strong></p>
<p>The first and third clauses can contain one or more 
expressions, separated by the <em>comma operator</em>. </p>
<p><strong>The <em>comma operator</em></strong></p>
<p>The comma operator guarantees 
that its left operand will be executed before its right operand. </p>

<p><strong>Behavior and purpose of the first 
clause</strong></p>
<p>The expressions in the first clause are 
executed only once, at the beginning of the loop. Any legal expression(s) 
may be contained in the first clause, but typically the first clause is used for 
initialization. </p>
<p><strong>Declaring and initializing variables 
in the first clause</strong></p>
<p>Variables can be declared and initialized in 
the first clause, and this has an interesting ramification regarding scope that 
will be discussed later. </p>
<p><strong>Behavior of the second clause</strong></p>
<p>The second clause consists of a single 
expression that must evaluate to a <strong>boolean</strong> type with a value 
of true or false. The expression in the second clause must eventually evaluate to false to cause the loop to 
terminate.</p>
<p>Typically relational expressions or relational and conditional 
expressions are used in the second clause. </p>
<p><strong>When the test is performed</strong></p>
<p>The value of the second clause is tested when the statement 
first begins execution, and at the beginning of each iteration thereafter. 
Therefore, just like the <strong>while</strong> loop, the <strong>for</strong> loop is an <em>entry condition loop</em>. </p>
<p><strong>When the third clause is executed</strong></p>
<p>Although the third clause appears physically at the top of the loop, it isn&#39;t 
executed until the statements in the body of the loop have completed 
execution. </p>

<p>This is an important point since this clause is typically used to update the 
control variable, and perhaps other variables as well. </p>
<p><strong>What the third clause can contain</strong></p>
<p>Multiple expressions can appear in the third clause, separated 
by the comma operator. Again, those expressions will be executed from 
left to right. If variables are updated in the third clause and used in the body 
of the loop, it is important to understand that they do not get updated until 
the execution of the body is completed. </p>
<p><strong>Declaring a variable in a <em>for</em> loop</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it is allowable to declare 
variables in the first clause of a <strong>for</strong> loop.</p>

<p>You can declare a variable with a given name outside 
<em>(prior to)</em> the <strong>for</strong> loop, or you can declare it inside the 
<strong>for</strong> 
loop, but not both. </p>
<p>If you declare it outside the <strong>for</strong> loop, you can access it either 
outside or inside the loop. </p>
<p>If you declare it inside the loop, you can access it only inside the 
loop. In other words, the scope of variables declared inside a <strong>for</strong> 
loop is limited to the loop. </p>
<p>This is illustrated in following sequence of four simple programs. </p>
<p><strong>This program won&#39;t compile</strong></p>
<p>The Java program shown in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> refuses to compile with a complaint 
that a variable named <strong>cnt</strong> has already been declared in the method when 
the attempt is made to declare it in the <strong>for</strong> loop. </p>

<p>The declaration of the variable named <strong>cnt</strong>, outside the

<p>However, this program refused to compile because an attempt was made to

	<p><strong>Empty clauses in a <em>for</em> loop</strong></p>
<p>The first and third clauses in a <strong>for</strong> loop can be 
left empty but the semicolons must be there as placeholders.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One author suggests that even the middle clause can be empty, but it isn&#39;t 
obvious to this author how the loop would ever terminate if there is no 
conditional expression to be evaluated. Perhaps the loop could be terminated by 
using a break inside the loop, but in that case, you might just as well 
use a <strong>while</strong> loop. </p>
<h2><a name="The_for_each_loop">The for-each loop</a></h2>
<p>There is another form of loop structure that is often referred to as a
<strong>for-each</strong> loop. In order to appreciate the benefits of 
this loop structure, you need to be familiar with Java collections and iterators, 
both of which are beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
<p>As near as I can tell, there is nothing that you can do with the <strong>
for-each</strong> loop that you cannot also do with the conventional <strong>for</strong> 
loop described above. Therefore, I rarely use it. You can find a description of 
the <strong>for-each</strong> loop on this Oracle
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html">
website</a>. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t plan to discuss it further in this chapter. However, before you go for 
a job interview, you should probably do some online research and learn about it 
because an interviewer could use a question about the <strong>for-each</strong> 
loop to trip you up in the Q and A portion of the interview.</p>

<h2><a name="thedowhileloop">The 
do-while loop</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>do-while</strong> loop is another implementation of the <em>loop</em> 
pillar mentioned <a href="#three_pillars">earlier</a>. However, it differs from 
the <strong>while</strong> loop and the <strong>for</strong> loop in one 
important respect; it is an <em>exit-condition</em> loop.</p>
<p><strong>An exit-condition loop</strong></p>
<p>Java provides an <em>exit-condition</em> loop 
having the syntax shown in <a href="#Figure_6">Figure 6</a>. </p>
<!--``1Fig006-->

</p>
<pre>
do {
    statements
              } while (conditional expression);
</pre>

</div>	<p><strong>Behavior</strong></p>
<p>The statements in the body of the loop continue to be 
executed for as long as the conditional expression evaluates to true. 
An exit-condition loop guarantees that the body of the loop will be 
executed at least one time, even if the conditional expression 
evaluates to false the first time it is tested. </p>
<h2><a name="thebreakandcontinuestatements">The break and continue statements</a></h2>
<p><strong>General behavior</strong></p>
<p>Although some authors suggest that the <strong>break</strong> and <strong>
continue</strong> statements provide an 
alternative to the infamous <strong>goto</strong> statement of earlier 
programming languages, it appears that the behaviors of the <strong>labeled break</strong> and <strong>labeled continue</strong> statements 
are much 
more restrictive than a general <strong>goto</strong>. </p>

<h2><a name="unlabeledbreakandcontinue">Unlabeled break and continue</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>break</strong> and <strong>continue</strong> statements are 
supported in both labeled and unlabeled form.</p>
<p>First consider the behavior of break and continue in 
their unlabeled configuration. </p>
<p><strong>Use of a <em>break</em> statement</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>break</strong> statement can be used in a switch 
statement or in a loop. When encountered in a switch statement, break 
causes control to be passed to the next statement outside the innermost 
enclosing switch statement. </p>
<p>When break is encountered in a loop, it causes control to be passed to 
the next statement outside the innermost enclosing loop. </p>
<p>As you will see later, labeled break statements can be used to 
pass control to the next statement following switch or loop statements 
beyond the innermost switch or loop statement when those 
statements are nested. </p>
<p><strong>Use of a continue statement</strong></p>
<p>The continue statement cannot be used in a switch statement, but can be used 
inside a loop.</p>
<p>When an unlabeled continue statement is encountered, it causes the current iteration 
of the current loop to be terminated and the next 
iteration to begin. </p>
<p>A labeled continue statement can cause control to be passed to the 
next iteration of an outer enclosing loop in a nested loop 
situation. </p>

<p>This section discusses the use of labeled break and 
continue statements. </p>

<h3><a name="labeledbreakstatements"></a>
Labeled break Statements</h3>
<p>One way to describe the behavior of a labeled break in 
Java is to say: &quot;Break all the way out of the labeled statement.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Syntax of a labeled statement</strong></p>
<p>To begin with, the syntax of a labeled statement is a label followed by a colon ahead of the statement 
as shown in <a href="#Figure_7">Figure 7</a>.</p>

</pre>

</div>	<p>The label can be any legal Java identifier.</p>
<p><strong>Behavior of labeled break</strong></p>
<p>The behavior of a labeled break can best be 
illustrated using nested switch statements. For a comparison of 
labeled and unlabeled switch statements, consider the 
program shown in <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> named <strong>switch1</strong>, which does not use a labeled 
break. Even though this program has a labeled statement, that statement is 
not referenced by a <strong>break</strong>. Therefore, the label is of no consequence.</p>

This is a Java application which serves as a baseline
comparison for switch2.java which uses a labeled break.

        case 1: System.out.println(
                            &quot;Match and break from here&quot;);

<p>After reviewing <strong>switch1.java</strong>, consider the same program 
named <strong>switch2.java</strong> shown in <a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a>, 
which was modified to 
use a labeled break. </p>
<p>The 
outputs from both programs are shown in the comments at the beginning of the 
program. By examining the second program, and comparing the output from the 
second program with the first program, you should be able to see how the use of 
the labeled break statement causes control to break all the way out of 
the labeled switch statement. </p>

<p>The modified program in <a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> uses a labeled break statement 
in the code group for <em>case 1</em> whereas the original program in
<a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> has an unlabeled break in that position. </p>
<p>By comparing the output from this program with the output from the 
previous program, you can see that execution of the labeled break 
statement caused control to break all the way out of the labeled 
switch statement completely bypassing <em>case 6</em> and default. </p>

<p>As you can see from examining the output, the labeled break 
statement causes the program to break all the way out of 
the switch statement which bears a matching label. </p>

<p>A similar situation exists when a labeled break is used in 
nested loops with one of the enclosing outer loops being labeled. Control will 
break out of the enclosing loop to which the labeled break refers. 
It will be left as an exercise for the student to demonstrate this behavior to 
his or her satisfaction. </p>

<h3><a name="labeledcontinuestatements"></a>
Labeled continue statements</h3>
<p>Now consider use of the labeled continue statement. A 
<strong>continue</strong> statement can only be used in a loop; it cannot be used in a 
switch. The behavior of a labeled continue statement can be 
described as follows: &quot;Terminate the current iteration and continue 
with the next iteration of the loop to which the label refers.&quot; </p>
<p>Again, it will be left as an exercise for the student to demonstrate this 
behavior to his or her satisfaction. </p>
<h3><a name="Even_or_odd">Even or odd</a></h3>
<p>It is often useful to be able to determine if a numeric value is even or odd. 
The code in <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> shows how to do that.</p>
<div class="a">
<p><a name="Listing_8">Listing 8</a>. The program named Odd.java.</p>
<pre>/*File Odd.java

<h2><a name="thereturnstatement">The 
return statement</a></h2>
<p><strong>Use of the return statement</strong></p>
<p>Java supports the use of the <strong>return</strong> 
statement to terminate a method and <em>(optionally)</em> return a value to 
the calling method.</p>
<p><strong>The return type</strong></p>
<p>The type of value returned must match the type 
of the declared return value for the method. </p>
<p><strong>The void return type</strong></p>
<p>If the return value is declared as <strong>void</strong>, you can use 
the syntax shown in <a href="#Figure_8">Figure 8</a> to terminate the method. <em>(You can also simply allow the 
method to run out of statements to execute.) </em> </p>




	
<!--``1Fig008-->
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_8">Figure 8</a>. An empty return statement.</p>
<pre>
return;</pre>

</div>	<p><strong>Returning a value</strong></p>
<p>If the method returns a value, follow the word 
return with an expression <em>(or constant)</em> that evaluates to the value 
being returned as shown in <a href="#Figure_9">Figure 9</a>.</p>




	
<!--``1Fig009-->
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_9">Figure 9</a>. Returning a value from a 
				method.</p>
<pre>
return x+y;
</pre>

</div>	<p><strong>Return by value only</strong></p>
<p>You are allowed to return only by <em>value</em>. 
In the case of primitive types, this returns a copy of the returned item. In the 
case of objects, returning by value returns a copy of the object&#39;s reference.</p>
<p><strong>What you can do with a copy the object&#39;s reference</strong></p>
<p>Having a copy of the reference is just as good as 
having the original reference. A copy of the reference gives you access to the 
object.</p>
<p><strong>When Java objects are destroyed</strong></p>
<p>All objects in Java are stored in dynamic memory 
and that memory is not overwritten until all references to that memory cease 
to exist. </p>
<p>Java uses a garbage collector running on a background thread to reclaim 
memory from objects that have become <em>eligible for garbage collection</em>. </p>
<p>An object becomes eligible for garbage collection when there are no longer 
any variables, array elements, or similar storage locations containing a 
reference to the object. In other words, it becomes eligible when there is no 
way for the program code to find a reference to the object. </p>



<h2><a name="exceptionhandling">Exception handling</a></h2>
<p>Exception handling is a process that modifies the flow of control of 
a program, so it merits being mentioned in this chapter. However, it is a fairly 
complex topic, which will be discussed in detail in 
future chapters. </p>
<p>Suffice it at this point to say that whenever an exception is detected, 
control is transferred to exception handler code if such code has been provided. Otherwise, the program will terminate. Thus, 
the exception handling system merits being mentioned in discussions regarding flow 
of control. </p>
