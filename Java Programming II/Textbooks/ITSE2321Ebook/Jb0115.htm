<p>The purpose of this chapter is to present the first complete Java program of 
the Ebook. This program previews the most common
forms of the three pillars of procedural programming: </p>
<ul>
	<li>sequence
</li>
	<li>selection
</li>
	<li>loop

</li>
</ul>
<p>The program also illustrates </p>
<ul>
	<li>calling a method, </li>
	<li>passing a parameter to the method, and</li>
	<li>receiving a returned 
value from the method.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, this is simply a preview. Detailed discussions of these 
topics will be presented in future chapters.</p>

<p>Comments were inserted into the program code to explain the code.</p>
<p>The compiler also ignores blank lines.

This program is designed to illustrate the most common
forms of the three pillars of procedural programming in
Java code:

sequence
selection
loop

The program also illustrates calling a method, passing
a parameter to the method, and receiving a returned 
value from the method.

Assuming that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is properly
installed on your computer, do the following to compile 
and run this program.

1. Copy this program into a file named FirstProgram.java
and store the file in a folder on your disk.
2. Open a command-line window in the folder containing
the file.
3. Type the following command to compile the program:
javac FirstProgram.java
4.4. Type the following command to run the program:
java FirstProgram

Any text that begins with // in the following program
code is a comment. The compiler will ignore everything
from the // to the end of the line.

The compiler also ignores blank lines.

Note that this program was designed to illustrate the
concepts while being as non-cryptic as possible.

The program should display the following text on the
screen except that the time will be different each time
that you run the program.

value in = 5
Odd time = 1353849164875
countA = 0
countA = 1
countA = 2
countB = 0
countB = 1
countB = 2
value out = 10
