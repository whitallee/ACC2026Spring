	<p>This chapter explains how array objects fit into the grand scheme of things 
in Object-Oriented Programming <em>(OOP)</em> using Java. Before continuing with 
	this chapter, I recommend that you study Kjell 
	<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap60/ch60_01.html">CHAPTER 60 — Arrays</a> through
	<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap67/ch67_01.html">CHAPTER 67 — Two-Dimensional Arrays</a>.</p>
<p>A different syntax is required to create array objects than the syntax 
normally used to create ordinary objects. </p>
<p>Array objects are accessed via references. Any of the methods of the <b>
Object</b> class can be called on a reference to an array object. </p>
<p>Array objects encapsulate a group of variables. The variables don&#39;t have 
individual names. They are accessed using positive integer index values. The 
integer indices of a Java array object always extend from <b>0</b> to <b>(n-1)</b> 
where <b>n</b> is the <b>length</b> of the array encapsulated in the object. </p>
<p>All array objects in Java encapsulate one-dimensional arrays. The component 
type of an array may itself be an array type. This makes it possible to create 
array objects whose individual components refer to other array objects. This is 
the mechanism for creating <i>multi-dimensional</i> or <i>ragged</i> arrays in 
Java. </p>
	<h1 class="auto-style2"><a name="Discussion_and_sample_code">Discussion and sample code</a></h1>
	<p><b>Three kinds of objects</b> </p>
<p>There are 
at least three kinds of objects involved in a Java program: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Ordinary objects</li>
	<li>Class objects</li>
	<li>Array objects</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the discussion up to this point in this Ebook has dealt with what I 
referred to in the above list as <i>ordinary objects</i>. These are the objects that you instantiate in your code by applying the <b>new</b> 
operator to a constructor for a class in order to create a new instance <i>
(object)</i> of that class. </p>
<p>Class objects will be discussed in a later chapter.</p>
<p>This chapter and some that follow will discuss array objects.</p>
<p>The existence of array objects tends to complicate the OOP structure of 
a Java program. Even if you don&#39;t consider 
array objects to be a different kind of object, you must at least consider them 
to be a <i>special</i> kind of object. A completely different syntax is required 
to create array objects than the syntax normally used to instantiate ordinary 
objects. </p>
<p><b>References to array objects</b> </p>
<p>Arrays are objects in Java <i>(at least, arrays are always encapsulated in 
objects).</i> Array objects are dynamically created. Like ordinary objects, 
array objects are accessed via references. The reference to an array object can 
be assigned to a reference variable whose type is specified as: </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>TypeName[] </pre>
</div>
<p>For example, <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> shows some unrelated 
declarations for variables that are capable of storing references to array 
objects. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. Sample variable 
				declarations for array objects.

				<pre>int[] x1;

Button[] x2;

Object[] x3;</pre>
</div>
	<p>Note the empty square brackets that are required in the variable 
	declarations in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. </p>
<p><b>The special case of type Object</b> </p>
<p>In addition, a reference to an array object may be assigned to a reference 
variable of type <b>Object</b> as shown in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>, 
where <strong>x4</strong> is a reference to an array object.</p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. The special case of type Object.

				<pre>Object x4;</pre>
</div>
	<p>Note that there are <i>no square brackets</i> in the statement in 
	Listing 2. </p>
<p><b>What does this mean?</b> </p>
<p>This means that like ordinary objects, a reference to an array object <em>can be 
treated </em>as type <b>Object </b><i>(with no square brackets).</i> </p>
<p>This further means that any of the methods defined in the <b>Object</b> class
<i>(such as the <b>toString</b> and <b>getClass</b> methods) </i>can be called 
on a reference to an array object. </p>
<p><b>The String representation of an array object&#39;s reference</b> </p>
<p>For example, when the <b>toString</b> method is called on a reference to an 
array object containing data of type <b>int</b>, the resulting string will be 
similar to the following: </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>[I@73d6a5 </pre>
</div>
<p><b>Pretty ugly, huh?</b> </p>
<p>You may recognize this as being similar to the default <b>String</b> returned 
by calling the <b>toString</b> method on an ordinary object with the name of the 
class for the ordinary object being replaced by <b>[I</b>. </p>
<p>For example, the <b>String </b>returned by calling the <b>toString</b> method 
on an object of the class named <b>Array04</b>, <i>(with no overridden toString 
method), </i>looks something like the following. </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>Array04@73d6a5 </pre>
</div>
<p><i>(Note that the hexadecimal numeric values following the @ in both of the 
above examples will change from one case to the next.)</i> </p>
<p><b>Calling the getClass method</b> </p>
<p>Similarly, calling the <b>getClass</b> method on references to array objects 
containing data of the types <b>Array04</b>, <b>Button</b>, and <b>int</b>, 
respectively, and then calling the <b>toString</b> method on the <b>Class</b> 
objects returned by the <b>getClass</b> method, produces the following: </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>class [LArray04;
class [Ljava.awt.Button;
class [I</pre>
</div>
<p><em>(The getClass method will be discussed in detail in a future chapter.)</em></p>
<p><b>Complicating the OOP structure</b> </p>
<p>I made the following statement in an earlier paragraph:</p>
<p><i>&quot;The existence of array objects tends to complicate the OOP structure 
of a Java program."</i></p>
<p><b>Array object is not a subclass of class Object</b> </p>
<p>An array object can be treated as type <b>Object</b> for purposes of calling 
the methods of the <b>Object</b> class on the reference to the array object. 
However, it would probably be misleading to say that an array object is 
instantiated from a subclass of the <b>Object</b> class. </p>
<p><b>The new operator and the constructor name</b> </p>
<p>Ordinary objects are created by applying the <b>new</b> operator to the 
constructor for a class, where the name of the constructor is always the same as 
the name of the class. That is not the case with array objects. Array objects 
are created by applying the <b>new</b> operator to the name of the type of data 
to be encapsulated in the array object. </p>
<p><b>Passing parameters versus square-bracket notation</b> </p>
<p>In addition, whereas the instantiation of ordinary objects involves 
parameters passed in parentheses, a square-bracket notation is used instead of 
parentheses to create an array object. The value in the square brackets 
specifies the <b>length</b> of the array. <em>(An array object has an accessible 
property named <strong>length</strong> that specifies the number of elements in the 
array.)</em></p>
<p><b>Creating an array object</b> </p>
<p>Array objects <i>(with <strong>default</strong> initialization values)</i> 
can be created by 
applying the <b>new</b> operator to the name of the data type to be stored in 
the array, using a square-bracket notation. An example is shown by the 
right-hand portion of the first statement in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. Creating array objects.

				<pre>int[] x1 = new int[5];

int[] x2 = {1,2,3,4,5};</pre>
</div>
	<p><b>A five-element array object</b> </p>
<p>The first statement in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> creates an array 
object capable of storing five values of type <b>int</b>. The statement also assigns the array object&#39;s 
reference to the newly-declared reference variable named <b>x1</b>. </p>
<p>Each element in the array is initialized to the default value zero or its 
equivalent.</p>
<p><i>(All array elements created in this manner receive a default initial 
value. Numeric primitive types receive an initial value of zero. Elements of 
type <b>boolean</b> receive an initial value of <b>false</b>. Elements whose 
type is the name of a class or the name of an interface receive an initial value 
of <b>null</b>.)</i></p>
<p><b>Explicit initialization</b> </p>
<p>The second statement in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> also creates an 
array object capable of storing five values of type <b>int</b>, but in this case, the values in the 
elements are explicitly initialized to the values shown.</p>
<p><i>(Note that the <b>new</b> operator is not used in the second statement in 
Listing 3. This is also a significant departure from the syntax used to 
instantiate ordinary objects.)</i></p>
<p>This array object&#39;s reference is assigned to the reference variable named <b>x2</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note the empty square brackets in the variable declarations</b> </p>
<p>The syntax of the type specification for the reference variable in each 
statement in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> 
is different from the syntax used in the type specification for either a 
primitive variable or an ordinary class type reference variable <i>(note the 
square brackets on the left in Listing 3)</i>. In <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a>, 
the type specifications indicate that each variable is capable of holding a 
reference to an array object. </p>
<p><b>The size of the array</b> </p>
<p>Furthermore, the empty square brackets <i>(in the declaration of the 
reference variable)</i> indicate that the reference variable doesn&#39;t know <i>
(and doesn&#39;t care)</i> about the size of the array to which it may refer. Each 
of the reference variables declared in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> can 
refer to a one-dimensional array object of any size. Also, each of the reference 
variables can refer to different array objects of different sizes at different points in time 
during the execution of the program. <em>(Note that size is not a keyword 
insofar as array objects are concerned. See the discussion of the <strong>length</strong> 
property later.)</em></p>



<div class="a"><b>The Array class</b>
				<p>As an aside, let me mention that there is a class named <b>
				Array</b>, which provides <strong>static</strong> methods to 
				dynamically create and access Java arrays. The use of the 
				methods of this class makes it possible to handle arrays with a 
				programming style similar to the programming style typically 
				used with ordinary objects. However, the use of the methods of 
				the <b>Array</b> class tends to require more programming effort 
				than the square-bracket notation discussed in this chapter. I 
				will discuss a sample program that illustrates the methods of 
				the <b>Array</b> class in a future chapter.</p>
</div>
	<p><b>Encapsulating a group of variables</b> </p>
<p>As is the case with other languages that support arrays, array objects in 
Java encapsulate a group of variables. </p>
<p>Zero or more variables may be encapsulated in an array object. If the number 
is zero, the array object is said to be empty.</p>
<p><i>(An example of an empty array object is the <strong>String[]</strong> 
array passed to the <strong>main</strong> method in a Java application when the user doesn&#39;t enter 
any arguments at the command line.)</i></p>
<p><b>No individual names</b> </p>
<p>Also, as with other languages that support arrays, the variables encapsulated 
in an array object don&#39;t have individual names. Rather, they are referenced 
using positive integer index values.</p>
<p><i>(Typically, in Java, the index is placed in square brackets, which are 
applied to the name of the reference variable holding a reference to the array 
object. Array indices begin with zero.)</i></p>
<p><b>Elements or components?</b> </p>
<p>It is common in the literature to refer to the variables that make up an 
array as its <i>elements</i>. However, the Java specification refers to them as
<i>components. </i>The specification ascribes a different meaning to the word 
element, as shown in the following quotation from the specification:</p>
<p><i>&quot;The value of an array component of type <strong>float</strong> is always 
an element of the <strong>float</strong> value set ...; similarly, the value of 
an array component of type <strong>double</strong> is always an element of the
<strong>double</strong> value set.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Another quotation from Sun <i>(shown later in this chapter)</i> provides a somewhat 
clearer distinction between the words <i>component</i> and <i>element</i>.</p>
<p><i>(However, from force of habit, I will probability use component and 
element interchangeably in this chapter.)</i></p>
<p><b>The length of an array</b></p>
<p>If an array has <b>n</b> components, the <strong>length</strong> of the array 
is <b>n</b>. 
The components of the array are referenced using integer indices from 0 to (n - 
1), inclusive. </p>
<p><b>Another quotation from Sun</b> </p>
<p>Here is another quotation from the Java specification that explains the type 
specifications for the variable declarations in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> 
and <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a>.</p>
<p><i>&quot;All the components of an array have the same type, called the component 
type of the array. If the component type of an array is T, then the type of the 
array itself is written T[].&quot;</i></p>
<p><b>Components may be of an array type</b> </p>
<p>As of this writing (2002), all array objects in 
Java encapsulate one-dimensional arrays <i>(I have read that this may change in 
the future).</i>
</p>
<p>The component type of an array may itself be an array type. This makes it 
possible to create array objects whose individual components refer to other 
array objects. </p>
<p><b>Multi-dimensional or ragged arrays</b> </p>
<p>One way to think of this is to think of the second level of array objects as 
being sub-arrays of the original array object. This construct can be used to 
create multi-dimensional array structures.</p>
<p><i>(The geometry of such multi-dimensional array structures is not 
constrained to be rectangles, cubes, etc., as is the requirement in many other 
languages. Some authors may refer to this as ragged arrays.)</i></p>
<p><b>Tree structures</b> </p>
<p>This process of having the components of an array contain references to 
sub-arrays can be continued indefinitely <i>(well, maybe not indefinitely, but 
further than I care to contemplate).</i></p>
<p><i>(This can be thought of as a tree structure where each array object 
containing references to other array objects is a node in the tree.)</i></p>
<p><b>The leaves of the tree</b> </p>
<p>Eventually, the components <i>(the leaves of the tree structure)</i> must 
refer to a component type that is not an array type. According to Sun:</p>
<p><i>&quot;... this is called the element type of the original array, and the <b>
components</b> at this level of the data structure are called the <b>elements</b> 
of the original array.&quot;</i></p>
<p><b>Component versus element</b> </p>
<p>Hopefully, the above quotation provides a somewhat clearer distinction 
between the use of the words <i>component</i> and <i>element</i> than was presented earlier 
but then again, maybe not. </p>
<p><b>Generic references</b> </p>
<p>Any array object's reference can also be assigned to reference variables 
of the types <b>Object</b>, <b>Cloneable</b>, or <b>Serializable</b>.</p>
<p><i>(<b>Object</b> is the class at the top of the inheritance hierarchy. <b>
Cloneable</b> and <b>Serializable</b> are interfaces, which are implemented by 
all array objects. Thus, a reference to an array object can be treated as any of 
these three types.)</i></p>
<p><b>Generic array objects</b> </p>
<p>Therefore, if the element type of an array object is one of these types, the 
elements in the array can refer to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Other array objects</li>
	<li>Ordinary objects</li>
	<li>A mixture of the two</li>
</ul>
<p>This is illustrated in the sample program named <b>Array05</b> shown in
<a href="#Listing_9">Listing 9</a> near the end of the chapter. </p>
<p><b>Will explain in fragments</b> </p>
<p>I will explain this program in fragments. <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> 
shows the beginning of the controlling class and the beginning of the <b>main</b> method 
for the program named <strong>Array05</strong>.. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. The beginning of the 
				class named Array05.

				<pre>
public class Array05{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int[] v1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
    Object[] v2 = new Object[2];</pre>
</div>
	<p> <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> 
	creates two array objects. </p>
<p><b>An array of type int</b> </p>
<p>The first array object is a five-element array of element type <b>int</b>, 
with the element values initialized as shown by the values within the curly 
brackets. The reference to this array object is assigned to the reference 
variable named <b>v1</b>. </p>
<p><b>An array of element type Object</b> </p>
<p>The second array object is a two-element array of element type <b>Object</b>, 
with each of the element values automatically initialized to their default value of <b>null</b>. 
The reference to the array object is assigned to the reference variable named <b>
v2</b>.</p>
<p><i>(Note that unlike the previous discussion of <b>Object</b>, the 
declaration of the reference variable in this case does include empty square 
brackets. I will have more to say about this later.)</i></p>
<p><b>A new object of this class</b> </p>
<p><a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> creates a new <i>ordinary object</i> of 
class <b>Array05</b>. The code assigns the object&#39;s reference to the first 
element in the array object of element type <b>Object</b>, referred to by the 
reference variable named <b>v2</b>. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. A new ordinary object of 
				class Array05.
				<pre>
    v2[0] = new Array05();</pre>
</div>
	<p>This is allowable because the reference to an object of any class can be 
	assigned to a reference variable of type <strong>Object</strong>.</p>
<p><i>(The array object referred to by <b>v2</b> contains two elements, each of 
which is a reference variable of type <b>Object</b>.)</i></p>
<p><b>Populate the second element</b> </p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> assigns the reference that 
points to the existing array object of 
the element type <b>int</b> to the second element in the array object of element 
type <b>Object</b>. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_6">Listing 6</a>. Populate the second element.
				<pre>
    v2[1] = v1;</pre>
</div>
	<p>This is allowable because a reference to any array object can be assigned 
	to a reference variable of type <b>Object</b>. </p>
<p><b>Array contains two references</b> </p>
<p>At this point, the array object of element type <b>Object</b> contains two 
references.</p>
<p><i>(Each of the elements in an array of the declared type <b>Object[]</b> is 
a reference of type <b>Object</b>.)</i></p>
<p>The first element refers to an ordinary object of the class <b>Array05</b>.</p>
<p>The second element refers to an array object of type <b>int</b>, having five 
elements, populated with the integer values of 1 through 5 inclusive.</p>
<p><i>(Note that this is not a multi-dimensional array in the traditional sense. 
I will discuss the Java approach to such multi-dimensional arrays in the next 
chapter. This is simply a generic array of element type <b>Object</b>, one 
element of which happens to contain a reference to an array object of type <b>
int</b>.)</i></p>
<p><b>Print some data</b> </p>
<p>The code in<a href="#Listing_7"> Listing 7</a> passes each of the references 
to the <b>println</b> 
method of the <b>PrintStream</b> class. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_7">Listing 7</a>. Print some data.
				<pre>
    System.out.println(v2[0]);
    System.out.println(v2[1]);</pre>
</div>
	<p>The <b>println</b> method causes the <b>toString</b> method to be called 
	on each reference. The <b>String</b> returned by the <b>toString</b> method 
	is displayed on the computer screen in each case. </p>
<p>This is allowable because any method defined in the <b>Object</b> class <i>
(including the <b>toString</b> method)</i> can be called on any reference stored 
in a reference variable of type <b>Object</b>. </p>
<p>This is true regardless of whether that reference is a reference to an 
ordinary object or a reference to an array object. </p>
<p><b>The output</b> </p>
<p><a href="#Listing_7"> Listing 7</a> causes the following two lines of text to 
be displayed: </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>Array05@15db9742
[I@6d06d69c</pre>
</div>
<p><b>Pretty ugly, huh?</b> </p>
<p>In both cases, this is the value of the <b>String</b> returned by the default 
version of the <b>toString</b> method defined in the <b>Object</b> class. Here 
is what Sun has to say about that default behavior:</p>
<p><i>&quot;Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the <b>
toString</b> method returns a string that &quot;textually represents&quot; this object. 
The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a 
person to read. It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The <b>toString</b> method for class <b>Object</b> returns a string 
consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the 
at-sign character `@&#39;, and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash 
code of the object.&quot;</i></p>
<p><b>Doesn&#39;t address array objects</b> </p>
<p>Obviously, this description of behavior doesn&#39;t address the case where the 
object is an array object, unless the characters <b>[I</b> are considered to be 
the name of a class. <i>(I will have a little more to say about this later.)</i>
</p>
<p><b>Produce some more output</b> </p>
<p>Finally, <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> shows the last statement in this 
simple program. </p>
<div class="a"><a name="Listing_8">Listing 8</a>. Produce some more output.
				<pre>
    System.out.println( ( (int[])v2[1] )[4] );
  }//end main
}//end class Array05</pre>
</div>
	<p><b>What does this mean?</b> </p>
<p>As you can see, the syntax of this statement is pretty ugly. </p>
<p>Values are accessed from an array object by following the array&#39;s reference 
with a pair of square brackets containing an integer index value as follows:</p>
<div class="a">
<pre>v2[1]</pre>
</div>
<p><b>Get the value at index 1 as type Object</b> </p>
<p>This code begins by accessing the component at index value 1 of the array 
object referred to by the reference variable named <b>v2</b><i>.</i> </p>
<p>The value retrieved is a reference, and is retrieved as type <b>Object</b>,
<i>(because the variable named <b>v2</b> was declared to be of type <b>Object[]</b>).</i>
</p>
<p><b>A cast is required</b> </p>
<p>A cast is used to convert from type <b>Object[] </b>to type <strong>int[]</strong> using 
the following code:</p>
<div class="a">
<pre>(int[])</pre>
</div>
<p>This produces a reference to an 
array object capable of containing values of type <b>int</b>. </p>
<p><b>Apply index to the int array</b> </p>
<p>After the type of the reference has been converted, the accessor <b>[4]</b> 
is applied to the reference. This causes the <b>int</b> value stored in the 
array object of type <b>int</b> <i>(at index value 4)</i> to be returned.</p>
<p><i>(If you refer back to <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a>, you will see that the integer value 5 was 
stored in the element at index value 4 of this array object.)</i> </p>
<p>You should try to remember this syntax and compare it with the syntax used in 
the Java approach to traditional multi-dimensional arrays, which I will discuss 
in the next chapter.</p>
<p><b>The output</b> </p>
<p>Thus, the code in <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> causes the number 5 to be displayed on the 
computer screen. The complete output from the program is shown below.</p>

<p><b>Let&#39;s recap</b> </p>
<p>To recap, the program named <b>Array05</b> creates a two-element array object 
capable of storing references of type <b>Object</b>. </p>
<p><b>Object is generic</b> </p>
<p>Because <b>Object</b> is a completely generic type, each of 
the elements in the array is capable of storing a reference to any ordinary 
object, or storing a reference to any array object. </p>
<p><b>Store reference to ordinary object in generic array</b> </p>
<p>The first element in the array is populated with a reference to an ordinary 
object instantiated from the class named <b>Array05</b>.</p>
<p><i>(Important: The actual object does not occupy the array element. Rather, 
the actual object exists someplace else in memory, and a reference to the object 
occupies the array element.)</i></p>
<p><b>Store a reference to an array object in the generic array</b> </p>
<p>The second element in the array of element type <b>Object</b> is populated 
with a reference to another array object capable of containing elements of type
<b>int</b>. </p>
<p>As above, the actual array object of type <b>int</b> does not occupy the 
second element. Rather, that array object exists someplace else in memory, and a 
reference to the array object occupies the second element in the array of 
element type <b>Object</b>. </p>
<p><b>Display some data</b> </p>
<p>After the array object of element type <b>Object</b> is created and 
populated, three print statements are executed to display information about the 
array object and its contents <i>(those print statements are shown in 
<a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> 
and </i> <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a><i>).</i> </p>
<p>The print statements produce the following output on the computer screen: </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>Array05@15db9742
[I@6d06d69c
5</pre>
</div>
<p><b>Default textual representation of ordinary object</b> </p>
<p>The first line of output is the default textual representation of the 
ordinary object, achieved by calling the default <b>toString</b> method on the 
reference to the ordinary object. </p>
<p><b>Default textual representation of array object</b> </p>
<p>The second line of output is the textual representation of the array object 
of type <b>int[]</b>, achieved by calling the default <b>toString</b> method on 
the reference to the array object. </p>
<p><b>Primitive value stored in array object</b> </p>
<p>The third line of text is the value stored in element index 4 of the <b>int[]</b> 
array object whose reference is stored in element index 1 of the array object of 
element type <b>Object</b>.</p>
<p><strong>Primitive versus non-primitive array element contents</strong></p>
<p>References to objects are stored in the elements of non-primitive array 
objects. The objects themselves exist somewhere else in memory.</p>
<p>Actual primitive values are stored in the elements of 
a primitive array object.</p>
<p>Thus, the elements of an array object contain actual primitive 
values, null references, or actual references to ordinary or array objects, 
depending on the type of the elements of the array object.</p>
	<h1 class="style1"><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p>This chapter begins an in-depth discussion of array objects in Java.</p>
<p>The existence of array objects tends to complicate the OOP structure of a 
Java program otherwise consisting only of ordinary objects. </p>
<p>A completely different syntax is required to create array objects than the 
syntax normally used to instantiate ordinary objects. Ordinary objects are 
normally instantiated by applying the <b>new</b> operator to the constructor for 
the target class passing parameters between a pair of matching parentheses. </p>
<p>Array objects <i>(with default initialization)</i> are created using the <b>
new</b> operator, the type of data to be encapsulated in the array, and a 
square-bracket notation to specify the <b>length</b> of the array encapsulated 
in the object. </p>
<p>Array objects with explicit initialization are created using a 
comma-separated list of expressions enclosed in curly brackets. </p>
<p>Arrays in Java are objects, which are dynamically created and allocated to 
dynamic memory. </p>
<p>Like ordinary objects, array objects are accessed via references. The type of 
such a reference is considered to be <b>TypeName[]</b> <i>(note the empty square 
brackets in the type specification).</i> </p>
<p>A reference to an array object can also be assigned to a reference variable 
of type <b>Object</b> <i>(note the absence of square brackets).</i> Thus, any of 
the methods of the <b>Object</b> class can be called on a reference to an array 
object. </p>
<p>As is the case with other languages that support arrays, array objects in 
Java encapsulate a group of zero or more variables. The variables encapsulated 
in an array object don&#39;t have individual names. Rather, they are accessed using 
positive integer index values. </p>
<p>The integer indices of a Java array object always extend from <b>0</b> to <b>
(n-1)</b> where <b>n</b> is the <b>length</b> of the array object. </p>
<p>As of the time of this writing (2002), all array objects in Java encapsulate 
one-dimensional arrays. However, the component type of an array may itself be an 
array type. This makes it possible to create array objects whose individual 
components refer to other array objects. This is the mechanism for creating <i>
multi-dimensional</i> or <i>ragged</i> arrays in Java. </p>
<p>The reference to any array object can be assigned to reference variables of 
the types <b>Object</b>, <b>Cloneable</b>, or <b>Serializable</b>. If the 
element type of an array object is one of these types, the elements in the array 
can refer to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Other array objects</li>
	<li>Ordinary objects</li>
	<li>A mixture of the two</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="style1"><a name="Whats_next">What&#39;s next?</a></h1>
<p>This chapter has barely scratched the surface in explaining how array objects 
fit into the grand scheme of things in OOP using Java. In the next chapter, I 
will continue the discussion, showing you some of the <i>(often complex)</i> 
aspects of using Java array objects to emulate traditional<i> multi-dimensional</i> 
arrays. I will also show you how to create <i>ragged</i> arrays in Java. </p>
