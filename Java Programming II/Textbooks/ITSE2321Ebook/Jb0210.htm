	<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>The first step in learning to use a new programming language is usually to 
learn the foundation concepts such as </p>
<ul>
	<li>variables, </li>
	<li>operators, </li>
	<li>types, </li>
	<li>expressions, 
</li>
	<li>flow-of-control, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter concentrates on the <strong>operators</strong> 
used in Java. </p>
<h1><a name="Operators">Operators</a></h1>
<h2><a name="Unary_and_binary_operators">Unary and binary operators</a></h2>
<p>Java provides a set of operators that can be used to perform an action on one, two, 
or three operands.</p>
<blockquote>According to Kjell, "<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap10/ch10_02.html#operand">An 
operand is a value that is acted upon by an operator.</a>"</blockquote>
<p>An operator that operates on one operand is called a <em>unary</em> 
operator. An operator that operates on two operands is called a <em>binary</em> 
operator. <em>(See Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap10/ch10_10.html">Subexpressions</a>.)</em>&nbsp; An operator that operates on three operands is called a <em>ternary</em> 
operator. <em>(See Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap34/ch34_02.html">If-Else Absolute Value</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Some operators can behave either as a unary or as a binary operator. The best 
known such operator is probably the minus sign <em>(-)</em>. <em>(See Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap09/ch09_25.html">Unary Minus</a>.)</em> As a binary operator, the minus sign 
causes its right operand to be subtracted from its left operand. As a unary 
operator, the minus sign causes the algebraic sign of the right operand to be 
changed. </p>
<h2>A <a name="ternary_">ternary</a> (conditional) operator</h2>
<p>Java has only one operator that takes three operands. It is a 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap34/ch34_02.html">conditional operator</a>, which I 
sometimes refer to as a cheap <strong>if</strong> statement.</p>
<p>The first operand is a <strong>boolean</strong> expression, which is followed by a question 
mark character <em>(?)</em>. The question mark is followed by a second operand, which is 
followed by a colon character <em>(:)</em>. The colon character is followed by the third 
operand.</p>
<p>If the <strong>boolean</strong> expression evaluates to true, the value of the operand following the ? is 
returned. Otherwise, the value of the operand following the : is returned.</p>
<p>An example of the syntax follows:</p>



<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Ternary operator syntax</strong>
				</p>
				<p>boolean expression ? value1 : value2</p>
				</div>
<h2><a name="Overloaded_operators">Overloaded operators</a></h2>
<p>Unlike C++, Java does not allow programmers to create overloaded operators in 
program code although Java does have built-in <a href="#overloaded_operator">
overloaded operators</a>.</p>
<h2>Operators from previous programs</h2>
<p>The statements in the following box illustrate the use of some of the 
operators from Java <a name="programs_in_earlier_chapters">programs in earlier chapters</a>:</p>
<pre
>=
!= 
+ 
(char)
</pre>



<div class="a">				<p><strong><a name="Operators_from_previous_programs">Operators from previous programs</a></strong>
				</p>
				<pre>
int ch1, ch2 = &#39;0&#39;;
while( (ch1 = System.in.read() ) != &#39;#&#39;) ch2 = ch1;
System.out.println(&quot;The char before the # was &quot; + (char)ch2);</pre>
</div>	<h2 ><a name="The_plus_and_cast_operators">The plus and cast operators</a></h2>
<p>Of particular interest in this list 
is the plus sign <em>(+)</em> and the cast operator <em>(char)</em>. </p>
<p>In Java, the plus sign can be 
used to perform arithmetic addition. It can also be used to concatenate strings. 
<em>(This means that the + operator is an <a name="overloaded_operator">overloaded operator</a>.)</em> <em>(Also 
see Kjell
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap44/ch44_11.html#overloaded">+ Operator</a>.) </em>When the plus sign is used in 
the manner shown above, the operand on the right is automatically converted to a character 
string before being concatenated with the operand on the left. </p>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3470/concatenation-programming">What Does Concatenation Mean?</a>
Concatenation, in the context of programming, is the operation of joining two strings together. The term "concatenation" literally means to merge two things together.</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_type_casting.asp">cast operator</a> is used in the above example to purposely convert the integer value 
contained in the <strong>int</strong> variable named <strong>ch2</strong> to a character type suitable for concatenating 
with the string on the left of the plus sign. <em>(See Kjell </em> 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap85/ch85_24.html"><em>Testing for Equality</em></a><em> and 
</em> 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap12/ch12_12.html"><em>nextInt</em></a><em> for 
more examples of the use of the cast operator.)</em> Otherwise, Java would attempt to 
convert and display the value of the <strong>int</strong> variable as a series of digits representing the 
<em>numeric value</em> of the character because the character is stored in a variable of 
type <strong>int</strong>. </p>
	<h2><a name="The_increment_operator">The increment operator</a></h2>
<p><em>(Also see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap31/ch31_06.html#increment_operator,_postfix">Prefix Increment Operator</a>.)</em></p>
<p>An extremely important <i>unary</i> operator is the increment operator 
identified by two plus characters with no space between them <em>(++)</em>. </p>
<p>The increment operator causes the value of its operand to be increased by 
one.
</p>



<div class="a">
	<p><strong>The decrement operator</strong></p>
<p>There is also a decrement operator <em>(--)</em> that causes 
				the value of its operand to be decreased by one.</p>
</div><p>The increment and decrement operators are used in both <i>prefix</i> and <i>postfix</i> notation.
</p>
<h2><a name="Prefix_and_postfix_increment_operators">Prefix and postfix increment 
and decrement operators</a></h2>
<p>With the <i>prefix </i>version, the operand appears to the right of the 
operator <em>( ++X)</em>, while with the <i>postfix</i> version, the operand 
appears to the left of the operator <em>(X++)</em>. </p>
<h3>What&#39;s the difference in prefix and postfix?</h3>
<p>The difference in prefix and postfix has to do with the point in the sequence 
of operations that 
the increment <em>(or decrement)</em> actually occurs if the operator and its operand appear as part of 
a larger overall expression. </p>
<p><em>(There is effectively no difference if the operator and its operand do 
not appear as part of a larger overall expression.)</em></p>
<h4>Prefix behavior</h4>
<p>With the <i>prefix</i> version, the variable is incremented <em>(or 
decremented)</em> before it is used 
to evaluate the larger overall expression. </p>
<h4>Postfix behavior</h4>
<p>With the <i>postfix</i> version, the variable is used to evaluate the larger 
overall expression before it is incremented <em>(or decremented)</em>. </p>
<h4>Illustration of prefix and postfix behavior</h4>
<p>The use of both the <i>prefix</i> and <i>postfix</i> versions of the 
increment operator is illustrated in the Java program shown in
<a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. The output produced by the program is show 
in the comments at the beginning of the program.</p>

	<h2><a name="Binary_operators_and_infix_notation">Binary operators and infix notation</a></h2>
<p>Binary operators use <i>infix</i> notation, which means that the operator 
appears between its operands. </p>
<h2><a name="General_behavior_of_an_operator">General behavior of an operator</a></h2>
<p>As a result of performing the specified action, an operator can be said to 
return a value <em>(or evaluate to a value)</em> of a given type. The type of 
value returned depends on the operator and the type of the operands. </p>



<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Evaluating to a value</strong>

	<h3>Conditional operators</h3>
<p>The relational operators are often combined with another set of operators <i>
(referred to as conditional or logical operators)</i> to construct more complex 
expressions. </p>
<p>Java supports three such operators as shown in the following table. <em>(Also see 
Kjell </em> <a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap18/ch18_21.html">
<em>Difference between AND and OR</em></a><em> and </em>
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap18/ch18_22.html"><em>NOT!</em></a><em>.)</em></p>



<div class="a">
	<p><strong><a name="Conditional_operators">Conditional 
				or logical operators</a></strong></p>
<pre>
Operator  Typical Use            Returns true if 
    
   &amp;&amp;     Left &amp;&amp; Right     Left and Right are both true
   ||     Left || Right     Either Left or Right is true
   !      ! Right           Right is false</pre>
</div>	<p>The operands shown in the table above must 
	be <strong>boolean</strong><i> </i>types, or must have 
	been created by the evaluation of an expression that returns a <strong>
	boolean</strong> 
	type.</p>
	
	<h3>Left to right evaluation</h3>
<p>An important characteristic of the behavior of the logical <strong><em>and</em></strong> 
and
the logical <strong><em>or</em></strong> operators is that the expressions are evaluated from left to 
right, and the evaluation of the expression is terminated as soon as the result 
of evaluating the expression can be determined. <em>(Also see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap09/ch09_24.html">Evaluate Equal Precedence from Left to Right</a> and 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap32/ch32_01.html">CHAPTER 32 — Boolean Expressions and
Short-circuit Operators</a>.)</em></p>
<p>For example, in the following expression, if the variable <strong>a</strong> 
is less than the variable <strong>b</strong> , there is no need to evaluate the 
right operand of the <strong>||</strong> to determine that the result of 
evaluating the entire expression would be <strong>true</strong>. Therefore, evaluation will terminate as soon as the answer can be 
determined. </p>



<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Left to right evaluation</strong></p>
<pre>
(a &lt; b) || (c &lt; d)</pre>
</div>	
<h2><a name="Bitwise_operators">Bitwise operators</a></h2>
<p>Java provides a set of 
<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Java-Bitwise-Operators">bitwise operators</a> that perform actions on their operands one 
bit at a time as shown in the following table. </p>



<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Bitwise operators</strong>
				</p>
				<pre>
Operator   Typical Use         Operation

                            by Dist bits (signed)  
 &lt;&lt;     OpLeft &lt;&lt; Dist      Shift bits of OpLeft left

 &amp;      OpLeft &amp; OpRight    Bitwise and of the 
                            two operands
 |      OpLeft | OpRight    Bitwise <i>inclusive </i>or of the 
                            two operands
 ^      OpLeft ^ OpRight    Bitwise <i>exclusive </i>or (xor) of 
                            the two operands
 ~      ~ OpRight           Bitwise complement of the right
                            operand (unary)</pre>
</div>	<h3>Populating vacated bits for shift operations</h3>
<p>The <i>signed</i> right shift operation populates the vacated bits 
with the sign bit, while the left shift and the <i>unsigned</i> right shift 
populate the vacated bits with zeros. </p>
<p>In all cases, bits shifted off the end are lost. </p>
<h3>The rule for bitwise <em>and</em></h3>
<p>The bitwise <strong>and</strong> operation operates according to the rule 
that the bitwise <strong>and</strong> of two 1 bits is a 1 bit. </p>
<p>Any other 
combination results in a 0 bit. </p>
<h3>Bitwise inclusive<i> </i><em>or</em></h3>
<p>For the <i>inclusive or</i>, if either bit is a 1, the result is a 1. 
</p>
<p>Otherwise, the result is a 0. </p>
<h3>Bitwise exclusive<i> </i><em>or</em></h3>
<p>For the <i>exclusive or</i>, if either but not both bits is a 1, the result 
is a 1. </p>
<p>Otherwise, the result is a 0. </p>
<p>Another way to state this is if the bits 
are different, the result is a 1. If the two bits are the same, the result is a 
0. </p>
<h3>The complement operator</h3>
<p>Finally, the complement operator changes each 1 to a 0 and changes each 0 to 
a 1. </p>
<h2><a name="Assignment_operators">Assignment operators</a></h2>
<h3>Simple assignment operator</h3>
<p>The <em>(=)</em> operator is a value assigning <i>binary </i>operator in Java. 
The value stored in memory and represented by the right operand is copied into 
the memory represented by the left operand. <em>(Also see Kjell </em>
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap09/ch09_11.html"><em>Assignment Statement Syntax</em></a><em>.)</em></p>
<h4>Using the assignment operator with reference variables</h4>
<p>You need to be careful and think about what you are doing when you use the 
assignment operator with reference variables in Java. If you assign one 
reference variable to another, you simply end up with two reference variables 
that refer to the same object. You do not end up with two different objects. </p>
<p><em>(If what you need is another copy of the object, you may be able to use the
</em>
<strong><em>clone</em></strong><em> 
method to accomplish that.)</em></p>
<h3>Shortcut assignment operators</h3>
<p>Java supports the following list of 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.in/java/operators/compound-assignment"> <i>shortcut</i> 
assignment operators</a>. These operators allow you to perform an assignment and 
another operation with a single operator. </p>

<h2><a name="The_lambda_operator">The lambda operator</a></h2>
<p>Note that this section and the next may be beyond your level of 
understanding at this point. You won't fully understand the code or the 
explanations that follow until you understand Java interfaces and generics. 
Interfaces are covered in this introductory course but generics are more complex 
and are not covered in this course.</p>
<p>However, I need to introduce you to these operators so that you will 
recognize them and won't be confused when you see them being used in code 
written by others. As far as I know, prior to the release of Java version 8, 
Java didn't support functions, only methods were supported. Something called 
lambda expressions were included in the release of version 8.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, A lambda expression is a way to define a small anonymous function in a single line of code. It is also known as an<em> anonymous function</em> or a 
<em>closure</em>. The syntax for a lambda expression is </p>
<pre><code class="!whitespace-pre-wrap hljs language-rust">(parameters) <span class="hljs-punctuation">-&gt;</span> { function_body }</code></pre>
<p>Here, parameters are the input parameters for the lambda function and function_body is the functionality that the lambda function performs on the input.
The lambda expression can only have one statement. If it has multiple statement then it needs to be enclosed in curly braces.

For example, the following lambda expression takes two integers as input and returns their sum:

</p>
<pre>(int a, int b) -&gt; a + b </pre>
<p>It can also be written like this

because Java 8 and later can infer the types of the parameters.</p>
<pre>(a, b) -&gt; a + b </pre>
<p>The character -&gt; is known as the lambda operator.</p>
<p>The lambda function can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a higher-order function. The main use case of lambda expressions is to define simple, throwaway functions in a concise way, typically as a function argument.</p>
<p>Listing 3 illustrates the definition and use of simple lambda expression. </p>
<div class="a">

<a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. A simple lambda expression.

<pre>
import java.util.function.Consumer;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Define a lambda expression that takes a string and prints it
    Consumer&lt;String&gt; printString = (String s) -&gt; System.out.println(s);
        
    // Use the lambda expression to print a string
    printString.accept("Hello, World!");
  }//End main
}}//End class
</pre>

</div>

<p>Continuing with information gleaned from <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, 
in this example, a lambda expression is defined that takes 
a single <strong>String</strong> parameter s and prints it to the console 
using the <strong>System.out.println</strong> method. The lambda expression is 
assigned to a variable named <strong>printString</strong> of type <strong>Consumer</strong> which is a 
functional interface.

</p>
<p>When the lambda expression is later used to print a string, the<strong> accept()</strong> method of the 
<strong>Consumer</strong> interface is called and 
passed the string "Hello, World!" as a parameter.

</p>
<p>When the program is run, it will output "Hello, World!" to 
the console.

</p>
<p>This example demonstrates how a lambda expression can be used to define a 
simple function and how it can be assigned to a variable and used just like any 
other object.</p>
<h2><a name="The_method_reference_operator">The method reference operator</a></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, the :: operator is known as the 
<em>method reference operator</em> in 
Java. It is used to refer to an existing method by name, 
without invoking it. Method references are a shorthand for a 
lambda expression that simply calls an existing method. It's 
a way to pass a method as an argument to another method, 
without having to explicitly create a lambda expression that 
calls that method.</p>
<p>The code in Listing 4 illustrates the use of the method reference operator.</p>
<div class="a">

<a name="Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. A method reference operator

<pre>
import java.util.function.Function;

public class Main01 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; parseInt = Integer::parseInt;
    
    int result = parseInt.apply("123");
    System.out.println(++result);
    
  }//End main
}//End class
</pre>

</div>

<p>Continuing with information gleaned from <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, 
in the above program, the "::" operator is used to <em>refer to</em> the <strong>parseInt</strong> method of the
<strong>Integer</strong> class. The <strong>parseInt</strong> 
method is being passed to the <strong>apply</strong> method of the 
<strong>Function</strong> interface. </p>
<p>When the <strong>apply</strong> method is called with the argument "123", 
it invokes the <strong>parseInt</strong> method 
and converts the string "123" to an integer 123 and saves it in a variable named
<strong>result</strong> of type <strong>int</strong>. The next statement 
increments result to prove that it is fact an integer and then prints it.</p>
<p>The <strong>apply</strong> method of the <strong>java.util.function.Function</strong> interface 
is a functional interface method that represents a function that takes in one 
argument and produces a result. The function is applied to the input argument 
and the result is returned. Listing 5 shows an example of how 
to use the <strong>apply</strong> method in program code.</p>
<div class="a">

<a name="Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. The apply method of the Function interface

<pre>
import java.util.function.Function;

public class Main02 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Function&lt;Integer, String&gt; intToString = Object::toString;
    String result = intToString.apply(5);
    
    Class&lt;?&gt; type = result.getClass();
    System.out.println("Type of result is: " + type.getName());
  }//End main
}//End class
</pre>

</div>

<p>The first two lines of code convert the value 5 of type <strong>int</strong> 
to type <strong>String</strong>. The last two lines of code confirm the 
conversion by printing "Type of result is: java.lang.String".</p>
