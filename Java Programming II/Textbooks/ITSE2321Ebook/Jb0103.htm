<p>Author's note: When reading this Ebook, please don't skip the page titled "<a href="Jb0101.htm">Jb0101</a>: Preface to Prof. Baldwin's ITSE 2321 Ebook". 
If you do, you will miss out on a lot of very important information.</p>

<h1><a name="Welcome">Welcome</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to Programming Fundamentals with Java.</p>
<p>In addition to the material presented in this Ebook, you may also find it useful to search the web for and study a few tutorials 
on the Windows "command prompt" as well as a few tutorials on Windows batch 
files. Here are a couple of possibilities that I found with a rudimentary 
search: </p>
<ul id="ul1004">
	<li id="li1013">
	<a id="a1015" href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/cmd-prompt.html" rel="nofollow">
	Windows Command Prompt in 15 Minutes </a></li>
	<li id="li1014">
	<a id="a1016" href="http://steve-jansen.github.io/guides/windows-batch-scripting/part-1-getting-started.html" rel="nofollow">
	Windows Batch Scripting: Getting Started </a></li>
</ul>
<p id="p1003">If you are using an operating system other than Windows, you may need to 
find similar tutorials that match up with the operating system that you are 
using.</p>
<p>Most of the topics in this Ebook are divided into two chapters -- a primary chapter and a 
review chapter. The review chapters contain review questions and answers keyed to 
the material in the primary chapters.</p>
<p>In case you find this Ebook insufficient, there are many good Java references 
that are freely available on the web. A short list of free reference material is provided <a href="Jb0101.htm">here</a>. 
In addition, many excellent books on Java are freely available for ACC students
<a href="http://go.oreilly.com/austin-cc">here</a>. You will need to log in with 
your ACC EID.</p>
<p>And, of course, you can always go to Google and ask a specific question such 
as <em>"what is an abstract method in java"</em> or <em>"what is an abstract 
class in java."</em> You will probably receive dozens, if not hundreds of answers.</p>
<h1><a name="The_DrJava_IDE">The DrJava IDE, the IntelliJ IDEA Edu, BlueJ, and the Java Development K</a>it</h1>
<p>In order to work with the material in this group of <em>Programming 
Fundamentals</em> chapters, you will 
need access to Oracle&#39;s 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java Development Kit</a>
<em>(JDK)</em>. Download and installation instructions are provided on that 
page.</p>
<p>You will also need access to a 
text editor, preferably one that is color-coded for Java programs. One such 
freely available text editor is named <a href="http://www.drjava.org/">DrJava</a>. DrJava is more than just a text editor. It is an Integrated 
Development Environment <em>(IDE)</em> that is designed for use by students 
learning how to program in the Java programming language. See <a href="http://www.drjava.org/docs/quickstart/index.html">A Quick Start Guide to DrJava</a> 
for instructions on downloading and installing the DrJava IDE. The Quick Start Guide also provides instructions for using the DrJava IDE. </p>
<p>Another IDE that some students seem to like is the
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=idea">IntelliJ 
IDEA Edu</a> (free as of 05/29/22). I haven't used this IDE so I can't vouch for 
it pro or con. </p>
<p>A third IDE that some students seem to like is 
<a href="https://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a>, described as <em>"A free Java Development Environment designed for beginners, used by millions worldwide"</em>. 
Again, I haven't used this IDE so I can't vouch for it pro or con. </p>
<p>However, you don't need an IDE to write, compile, and run the programs 
in this course. All you need is a text editor that can be used to create 
files containing plain text and the JDK mentioned above. A Google search will 
identify several suitable text editors. For example, you might want to consider 
the use of <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a> as 
your text editor.</p>
