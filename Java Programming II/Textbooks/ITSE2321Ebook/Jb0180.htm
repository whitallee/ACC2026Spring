	<h1><a name="Preface">Preface</a></h1>
	<p>This chapter is part of an Ebook designed to help you 
	learn to program computers. </p>
<p>Every Java application requires a class containing a method named <strong>
main</strong>. 
This chapter provides information on the <strong>main</strong> method. <em>(Also 
see Kjell <a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap06/ch06_04.html">Between the Braces</a>.)</em></p>

	<h1><a name="The_main_method_in_Java">The main method in Java</a></h1>
	<p>There must be a <strong>main</strong> method in the controlling <em>
	(driver)</em> class in 
	every Java application.</p>
<p>Any and/or all classes in a Java application can have a <strong>main</strong> 
method. Only the one in the <em>controlling class</em> for the program being 
executed is actually called.</p>
<p>It is often desirable to provide a <b>main</b> method for a class that will 
not ultimately be the <i>controlling class</i> to allow the class to be tested 
in a stand-alone mode, independent of other classes. </p>
<h2>The method signature</h2>
<p>The Java literature frequently refers to the signature of a method, or the
<em>method signature</em>. </p>
<p><em>Exploring Java</em> by Patrick Niemeyer and Joshua Peck (O&#39;Reilly) provides 
the definition of a method signature shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.
<em>(Also see Kjell 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap47/ch47_10.html#signature">Method Definition</a>, which doesn't agree entirely with <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.)</em></p>

<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Figure_1">Figure 1.</a> The method signature according to 
Niemeyer and Peck.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&quot;A method signature is a collection of information about the method, as in a 
C prototype or a forward function declaration in other languages. It includes 
the method&#39;s name, type, and visibility, as well as its arguments and return 
type.&quot;</p>
</div>




<h2>Type</h2>
<p>Apparently in this definition, the authors are referring to the <em>type</em> 
of the method as distinguishing between static and non-static. <em>(Other 
literature refers to the type of a function or method as being the return type 
which according to the above definition is a separate part of the signature.) </em></p>
<h2>Visibility</h2>
<p>Apparently also the use of the word visibility in the above definition refers 
to the use of <strong>public</strong>, <strong>private</strong>, etc. Kjell 
refers to this as
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap47/ch47_10.html#signature">
modifiers</a>.</p>
<h2>According to Oracle...</h2>
<p>Oracle&#39;s
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html">Java 
Tutorials</a>, on the other hand, describe the method signature as in 
<a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>. </p>




<div class="a">
<p>
<a name="Figure_2">Figure 2.</a> The method signature according to Oracle.</p>
<p>Definition: Two of the components of a method declaration comprise the method signature -- the method's name and the parameter types. 
</p>

<p>As you can see, the Oracle definition is more restrictive than the Niemeyer and Peck definition 
and agrees with the Kjell definition.</p>
</div>
<h2>Bottom line on method signature</h2>
<p>The method signature can probably be thought of as providing information about the programming interface to the method. In other words, it 
provides the information that you need to be able to call the 
method in your program code. </p>
<h2>Signature of main method</h2>
<p>The controlling class of every Java application must contain a <strong>main </strong>method having one of the signatures 
shown in <a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<!--``1Fig003-->
<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Figure_3">Figure 3</a>. Allowable signatures for 
				the main method.
</p>
<pre>
public static void main(String[] args)

public static void main(String args[])
</pre></div>

<p><em>(I prefer the first 
signature in </em><a href="#Figure_3"><em>Figure 3</em></a><em> as being the most descriptive of an array of
</em> <strong><em>String </em> </strong>
<em>references which is what is passed in as an argument.)</em></p>
<h2>public</h2>
<p>The keyword <strong>public</strong> indicates that the method can be called 
by any object. A future chapter will discuss the keywords <strong>public</strong>,
<strong>private</strong>, and <strong>protected</strong> in more detail. </p>
<h2>static</h2>
<p>The keyword <strong>static</strong> indicates that the method is a <em>class</em> 
method, which can be called without the requirement to instantiate an object of 
the class. This is used by the JVM to launch the program by calling the <strong>
main</strong> method of the class identified in the command to start 
the program. </p>
<h2>void</h2>
<p>The keyword <strong>void</strong> indicates that the method doesn&#39;t return 
any value. </p>
<h2>args</h2>
<p>The formal parameter <strong>args</strong> is a reference to an array object 
of type <strong>String</strong>. The array elements contain references to
<strong>String</strong> objects that encapsulate <strong>String</strong> 
representations of the arguments, if any, entered at the 
command line. </p>
<p>Note that the <strong>args</strong> parameter must be specified 
whether or not the user is required to enter command-line arguments and whether 
or not the code in the program actually makes use of the argument. Also note 
that the name can be any legal Java identifier. It doesn&#39;t have to be 
<strong>args</strong>. It 
could be joe or sue, for example but args is more descriptive of the purpose.</p>
<h2>The length property</h2>
<p>The parameter named <strong>args</strong> is a reference to an array object. Java array 
objects have a property named 
<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-find-array-length-in-java">length</a>, which specifies the 
number of elements in the array. <em>(Also see J<a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/java/java-array-length/">ava Array Length Tutorial With Code Examples</a>.)</em></p>
<p>The runtime system monitors for the entry of command-line arguments by the 
user and constructs the <strong>String </strong>array containing those 
arguments.</p>
<h2>Processing command-line arguments</h2>
<p>The <strong>args.length</strong> property can be used by the code in the 
program to determine the number of arguments actually entered by the user. </p>
<p>If the <strong>length</strong> property is not equal to zero, the first 
string in the array corresponds to the first argument entered on the command 
line.</p>
<p>Command-line arguments along with strings and <strong>String</strong> arrays 
will be discussed in more detail in a future chapter.</p>
