	<h1><a name="Preface">Preface</a></h1>
	<p>This chapter provides a very brief treatment of exception handling. The 
	topic is discussed in detail in the later chapter titled <em>Java OOP: Exception Handling</em>. 
	The topic is included in this <em>Programming Fundamentals</em> section simply to 
	introduce you to the concept.</p>

<p><strong>What is an exception?</strong></p>
<p>According to
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/">The Java 
Tutorials</a>, <em>&quot;An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of 
a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A very common example of an exception given in textbooks is code that 
attempts to divide by zero <em>(this is easy to demonstrate)</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Throwing an exception</strong></p>
<p>Common terminology states that when this happens, the system <em>throws an 
exception</em>. If a thrown exception is not <em>caught</em>, a runtime error may occur.
</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of exception handling</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of exception handling is to make it possible for the program to 
either attempt to recover from the problem, or at worst shut down the program in 
a graceful manner, whenever an exception occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Java supports exception handling</strong></p>
<p>Java, C++, and some other programming languages support exception handling in 
similar ways.</p>
<p>In Java, the exception 
can be thrown either by the system or by code created by the programmer. There 
is a fairly long list of exceptions that will be thrown automatically by the 
Java runtime system.</p>
<p><strong>Checked exceptions cannot be ignored</strong></p>
<p>Included in that long list of automatic exceptions is a subset known as &quot;checked&quot; exceptions. 
Checked exceptions cannot be ignored by the programmer. A method must either 
specify <em>(declare)</em> or catch all &quot;checked&quot; exceptions that can be thrown in order for the 
program to compile. </p>
<p><strong>An example of specifying an exception</strong></p>
<p>I explain the difference between specifying and catching an exception in 
	the future chapter titled <em>Java OOP: Exception Handling</em>. For now, suffice it to say that the code that begins with the 
word &quot;throws&quot; in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> specifies <em>(declares)</em> an exception that 
can be thrown by the code inside the <strong>main</strong> method. </p>
<p>If this specification is not made, the program will not compile. </p>

<div class="a"><a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. The program named 
				simple1.
<pre>
/*File simple1.java Copyright, R.G.Baldwin
**********************************************************/
class simple1 { //define the controlling class
  public static void main(String[] args) 
                               throws java.io.IOException {
    int ch1, ch2 = &#39;0&#39;;

    System.out.println(
      &quot;Enter some text, terminate with #&quot;);

    //Get and save individual bytes
    while( (ch1 = System.in.read() ) != &#39;#&#39;) ch2 = ch1;

    //Display the character immediately before the #
    System.out.println(&quot;The char before the # was &quot;
      + (char)ch2);
  }//end main
}//End simple1 class.
</pre>
</div>
<!--``2-->
	<p>The program in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> does not throw any 
	exceptions directly nor does it attempt to catch any exceptions. However, it can throw exceptions indirectly through its 
	call to <strong>System.in.read</strong>. </p>
<p>Because <strong>IOException</strong> is a checked exception, the <strong>main</strong> 
method must either specify it or catch it . Otherwise the program won&#39;t compile. 
In this case, the <strong>main</strong> method specifies the exception as 
opposed to catching it.</p>
<p><strong>Very brief treatment</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this is a very brief treatment of a fairly complex 
topic that is discussed in much more detail in the chapter titled
<em>Java OOP: Exception Handling.</em> The 
topic was included at this point simply to introduce you to the concept of 
exceptions.</p>
<h1><a name="Run_the_program">Run the program</a></h1>
<p>II encourage you to copy the code from <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. Compile the code and execute 
it. Experiment with the code, 
making changes, and observing the results of your changes. Make certain that you 
can explain why your changes behave as they do.</p>
