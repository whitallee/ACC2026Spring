<h2><a name="Meet_Bucky">Meet Bucky</a></h2>
<p>If you are a student who likes to learn from videos, I will take this 
opportunity to introduce you to a series of Java educational videos at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u8rFbpdvds&amp;list=PL484D73FA74A11AC9&amp;index=3">
Java Programming Tutorial - 2 - Running a Java Program</a>. I will refer to some 
of those video tutorials later in this Ebook. Note however that this video is 
not a substitute for studying the Kjell material in the next section. Also note 
that Bucky's tutorial titled
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl-zzrqQoSE&amp;list=PL484D73FA74A11AC9&amp;index=1">Java Programming Tutorial - 1 - Installing the JDK</a> 
is somewhat dated so you should skip it and depend instead on the instructions 
given <a href="#Installation_of_the_JDK">below</a> for the installation of the required software..</p>
<h2><a name="Meet_Professor_Bradley_Kjell">Meet Professor Bradley Kjell</a></h2>
<p>Before we go any further, I strongly recommend that you study the first seven 
chapters of <a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/index.html#part02">Introduction to Computer Science using Java</a> by Professor Bradley Kjell of Central Connecticut State University. 
Make sure that you understand the material in chapters 1 through 4 and then pay particular attention to 
the Java material in chapters 5 
through 7. Be sure to take advantage of the interactive Quizzes, Flash Cards, 
and Reviews.</p>
<h2><a name="Writing_the_code">Writing Java code</a></h2>
<p>You will find that some of the material in this and the following sections duplicates material in the Kjell chapters. You will also find material here that is 
not in the Kjell chapters, such as the use of batch files to compile and run 
Java programs.</p>
<p>As you learned in from Kjell, writing Java code is straightforward. You can write Java code 
using any plain text editor. You simply need to cause the output file to have 
an extension of .java.</p>
<p>There are a number of high-level <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em> 
available, such as Eclipse and NetBeans, but they tend to be overkill for the relatively simple Java programs 
described in these chapters.</p>
<p>There are also some low-level IDEs available, such as JCreator, DrJava, 
IntelliJ, and BlueJ that are very useful. I normally use a free version of 
JCreator, mainly because it contains a color-coded editor <em>(but it no longer 
seems to be available)</em>.</p>
<p>So, just find an editor that you are happy with and use it to write your Java 
code.</p>
<h2><a name="Preparing_to_compile_and_run_Java_code">Preparing to compile and 
run Java code</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most complicated thing is to get your computer set up for 
compiling and running Java code in the first place.</p>
<h3><a name="The_java_development_kit">Downloading the java development kit <em>(JDK)</em></a></h3>
<p>You will need to download and install the free Java JDK from
the Oracle website. As of 05/30/22, you will find that website at
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html">
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html</a> </p>
<p>There is a 64-bit version of the JDK, which works well on my home computer 
and on my office computer running Windows 7.</p>
<h3><a name="Installation_of_the_JDK">Installing the JDK</a></h3>
<p>As of 05/30/22, you will find a link to installation instructions on that 
same web page. If you know how to do so and choose to do so, you can set the 
path in <a name="a_semi-permanent_way">a semi-permanent way</a> by modifying the path environment variable. 
However, that is not necessary nor is it particularly desirable. You can also set the path temporarily each time you compile and run your program. See 
the comments following <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> to learn how to set the path temporarily.</p>
<h3><a name="The_JDK_documentation">The JDK documentation</a></h3>
<p>It is very difficult to program in Java without access to the documentation. A link to 
the full documentation set is also available on that same page. A page 
containing links to all classes and interfaces for Java SE 18 is available
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/allclasses-index.html">
here</a>. An alphabetical index is available
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/index-files/index-1.html">
here</a>. Documentation for Java SE 8 in an earlier format is available
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Compiling_and_running_Java_code">Compiling and running Java code</a></h2>
<p>There are a variety of ways to compile and run Java code. The way that I will 
describe here is the most basic and, in my opinion, the most reliable. These instructions 
apply to a Windows operating system. If you are using a different operating 
system, you will need to translate the instructions to your operating system.</p>
<h3><a name="Write_your_Java_program">Write your Java program</a></h3>
<p>Begin by using your text editor to write your Java program into one or more 
text files, each with an extension of 
.java. <em>(Files of this type are often referred to as source code files.)</em> Save the 
source code files in an empty folder somewhere on your disk. Make sure that the 
name of the <strong>class</strong> containing the <strong>main</strong> 
method <em>(which you will learn about in a future chapter)</em> matches the name of the 
file in which that class is contained <em>(except for the extension of .java on the file name, 
which does not appear in the class name)</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="Create_a_batch_file">Create a batch file</a></h3>
<p class="style2">Use your text editor to create a batch file <em>(or whatever the equivalent is for your operating system)</em> 
containing the commands shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> <em>(with the 
modifications discussed below)</em> and store it in the same folder as your Java 
source code files.</p>
<p>Then execute the batch file, which in turn will compile and execute the program if there 
are no compilation errors.</p>

<div class="a">
<a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. Windows batch file.

<pre>
echo off
cls
rem path="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13\bin";%path%
del *.class

javac -cp .; hello.java
java -cp .; hello 5

pause</pre>
</div>

<h4>Comments regarding the batch file</h4>

<p>The commands in the batch file of <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> will </p>
<ul>
	<li>Open a command-line screen for the folder containing the batch 
	file.</li>
	<li>Delete all of the compiled class files from the folder. <em>(If the folder 
	doesn&#39;t contain any class files, this will be indicated on the command-line 
	screen.)</em></li>
	<li>Temporarily set the path (optional) If you chose to set the path in a
	<a href="#a_semi-permanent_way">semi-permanent way</a>, you can delete the 
	line that begins with rem (or just leave it alone because it is a comment). 
	To set the path temporarily, delete the word rem and the space that follows 
	that word. Then replace "jdk-13" with the name of the folder containing your 
	installation of the JDK. If you installed it in the default location, that 
	folder would normally be found in a location such as the following: 
	"C:\Program Files\Java"</li>
	<li>Attempt to compile the program in the file named <strong>hello.java</strong> </li>
	<li>Attempt to run the compiled program using a compiled Java file named
	<strong>hello.class</strong> with 
	an optional command-line argument value of 5.</li>
	<li>Pause and wait for you to dismiss the command-line screen by pressing a 
	key on the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>If errors occur, they will be reported on the command-line screen and the 
program won&#39;t be executed.</p>
<p>If your program is named something other than <strong>hello</strong>, 
<em>(which it typically would be)</em> substitute the new name for the word <strong>hello</strong> 
where it appears twice in the batch 
file.</p>
<h4>The optional command-line argument</h4>
<p>When running a Java program, it is sometimes necessary to provide a 
command-line argument when you start the program. See
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/understanding-command-line-arguments-and-how-to-use-them/">Understanding Command Line Arguments and How to Use Them</a> for an 
understanding of command-line arguments. The "5" following the word "hello" in
<a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> shows how to enter a command-line argument 
when you run a Java program from the command line. If the program was written to 
use the argument, it will access and use it. Otherwise, the program will simply 
ignore the argument.</p>
<h4>Don&#39;t delete the pause command</h4>
<p>The <strong>pause</strong> command causes the command-line window to stay on the 
screen until you dismiss it by pressing a key on the keyboard. You will need to examine the contents of the window if there are errors 
when you attempt to compile and run your program, so don&#39;t delete the pause 
command.</p>

<blockquote>Note: it is not necessary to use a batch file to compile and run 
	Java programs. You can also compile and run a program by opening a command 
	line window in the folder containing the source code and entering the 
	following statements manually. As before, the path command and the 
	command-line argument are optional.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>
path="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13\bin";%path%
del *.class

javac -cp .; hello.java
java -cp .; hello 5
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	However, if you expect to compile and run your program more than 
	once, it is much more convenient to create the batch file once and then use 
	it over and over.</blockquote>

<h4>Opening a command-line window

</h4>

<p>The instructions for opening a command-line window in a particular folder 
normally go something like this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Press the Windows Start button</li>
	<li>Enter the following command in the input field:
	<pre>cmd</pre>
</li>
	<li>Use navigation commands to navigate to the desired folder</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a much easier way to do the same thing.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open the desired folder in the Windows file manager</li>
	<li>Create a batch file named WhateverYouPrefer.bat containing the following 
	single command:
	<pre>cmd</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Double-click the batch file to open the command-line window in the 
	selected folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach eliminates the command-line navigation issue that can be 
tedious and prone to error. </p>

<h4>Running a precompiled program</h4>
<p>If you are given a precompiled program file, such as a file named 
hello.class, you can create a batch file for running that program by copying the batch file in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> and deleting all 
lines other than the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>echo off
</li>
	<li>cls
</li>
	<li>rem path="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13\bin";%path%
</li>
	<li>java -cp .; hello

	5</li>
	<li>pause</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, the path and command-line arguments are optional.</p>
<h4>Translate to other operating systems</h4>
<p>The format of the batch file in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> is a Windows format. If 
you are using a different operating system, you will need to translate the 
information in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> into the correct format for your operating system.</p>
<h3><a name="A_test_program">A test program with a single source code file</a></h3>
<p>The test program in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> can be used to confirm that Java is properly 
installed on your computer and that you can successfully compile and execute 
Java programs.</p>
<div class="a">
<a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. A test program with a single source code file.

<pre>class hello {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }//end main
}//end class
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>Copy the code shown in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> into a text file 
named <strong>hello.java</strong> and store the file in an empty folder somewhere on your disk.</p>
<p>Create a batch file named <strong>hello.bat</strong> containing the commands 
shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> and store that file in the same folder as the file named
<strong>hello.java</strong>.</p>
<p>Execute the batch file.</p>
<p>If everything is working, a command-line screen 
should open and display the following text:</p>
<pre>Hello World
Press any key to continue . . .</pre>

<h3><a name="A_test_program2">A test program with two source code files</a></h3>
<p>Most of the programs in this course will require two or more source code 
files. <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> and <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> provide examples of two source code files in such 
a program.</p>

<div class="a">
<a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. Driver class for a test program with two source code files.

<pre>class hello{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    new helloRunner().run();
  }//end main method
}//end class</pre>
</div>


<p>`</p>
<div class="a">
<a name="Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. Runner class for a test program with two source code files.

<pre>
class helloRunner{
  void run(){
    System.out.println("Hello World from helloRunner");
  }//end run method
}//end class</pre>
</div>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>Copy the code shown in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> into a new text file 
named <strong>hello.java</strong> and store the file in an empty folder somewhere on your disk.</p>
<p>Copy the code shown in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> into a text file 
named <strong>helloRunner.java</strong> and store the file in the same folder.</p>
<p>Copy the batch file named <strong>hello.bat</strong> into the same folder as the files named
<strong>hello.java</strong> and <strong>helloRunner.java</strong>.</p>
<p>Execute the batch file.</p>
<p>If everything is working, a command-line screen 
should open and display the following text:</p>
<pre>
Hello World from helloRunner
Press any key to continue . . .</pre>

<h3><a name="Congratulations">Congratulations</a></h3>
<p>If both test programs compile and run successfully, you have just written, compiled and 
executed a simple Java program on your computer.</p>
<h3><a name="Oops">Oops</a></h3>
<p>If that doesn&#39;t happen, you need to go back to the installation instructions 
and see if you can determine why the JDK isn&#39;t properly installed.</p>
<p>If you get an error message similar to the following, that probably means 
that you didn&#39;t set the <strong>path</strong> environment variable correctly. </p>
<pre>&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.</pre>
<p>Beyond that, I can&#39;t provide much advice in the way of troubleshooting hints.</p>
