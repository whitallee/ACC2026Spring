	<p><strong>Static members</strong></p>
<p>There is another aspect of OOP in Java that I have mainly avoided up to this point 
in the discussion: <em><strong>static</strong></em> variables and <em><strong>static</strong></em> methods. </p>
<p><strong>Tends to complicate ...</strong> </p>
<p>I have avoided this topic because, while not particularly difficult, the 
existence of <strong>static</strong> members tends to break up the simple structures that I have 
discussed in previous chapters in this Ebook. </p>
<p>While <strong>static</strong> members can be useful in some situations, the existence of 
<strong>static</strong> members tends to complicate the overall object-oriented structure of 
Java. </p>
<p><strong>Avoid overuse of <strong>static</strong> members</strong> </p>
<p>Furthermore, the overuse of <strong>static</strong> members can lead to problems similar to 
those experienced in languages like C and C++ that support global variables and 
global functions. </p>
<p><strong>When to use static members</strong> </p>
<p>I will discuss the use of <strong>static</strong> members in this chapter, and will provide 
some guidelines for their use. </p>
<p><strong>The class named Class</strong> </p>
<p>I will also introduce the class named <strong>Class</strong> and discuss how 
it enters into the use of <strong>static</strong> variables and methods. </p>
<p><strong>Instance members versus class members</strong> </p>
<p>I will describe the differences between <em>instance</em> members and <em>
class</em> members with particular emphasis being placed on their accessibility.
</p>
<p><strong>Three kinds of objects</strong> </p>
<p>From a conceptual viewpoint, there are at least three kinds of objects 
involved in a Java program:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ordinary objects</li>
	<li>Array objects</li>
	<li>Class objects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ordinary objects</strong></p>
<p>Much of the discussion up to this point in the 
Ebook deals with what I have referred to in the above list as <em>ordinary 
objects</em>. </p>
<p>These are the objects that you instantiate in you code by applying the
<strong>new</strong> operator to a constructor for a class in order to create a 
new instance <em>(object)</em> of that class. <em>(There are also a couple of 
other ways to create ordinary objects, but I&#39;m not going to get into that at 
this time.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Array objects</strong> </p>
<p>I also discussed array objects in three previous chapters. Recall that array objects are objects whose purpose is to 
encapsulate a one-dimensional array structure that can contain either primitive 
values, or references to other objects <em>(including other array objects).</em> </p>
<p><strong>Class objects</strong></p>
<p>I will discuss Class objects in this chapter.</p>
	<h1 class="auto-style2"><a name="Discussion_and_sample_code">Discussion and sample code</a></h1>
	<p><strong>Class objects</strong></p>
<p>Let me emphasize at the beginning that the following discussion is <strong>
<em>conceptual</em></strong> in nature. In this discussion, I will describe how 
the Java system behaves, not necessarily how it is implemented. In other words, 
however it is implemented, it behaves as though it is implemented in the manner 
described below. </p>
<p><strong>The class named Class</strong> </p>
<p>There is a class whose name is <strong>Class</strong>. The purpose of this 
class is to encapsulate information about some other class <em>(actually, it can 
also be used to encapsulate information about primitive types as well as class 
types).</em> </p>
<p>Here is part of what Sun has to say about this class: </p>
<div class="a">
<p><em>&quot;Instances of the class <strong>Class</strong> represent classes and 
interfaces in a running Java application. ...</em> </p>
<p><em><strong>Class</strong> has no public constructor. Instead <strong>Class</strong> 
objects are constructed automatically by the Java Virtual Machine as classes are 
loaded ...&quot;</em> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong> </p>
<p>As a practical matter, when one or more objects are instantiated from a given 
class, an extra object of the <strong>Class</strong> class is also instantiated 
automatically. This object contains information about the class from which the 
objects were instantiated. <em>(Note that it is also possible to cause a <strong>
Class</strong> object that describes a specific class to be created in the 
absence of objects of that class, but that is a topic that will be reserved for 
more advanced courses.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>A real-world analogy</strong> </p>
<p>Here is an attempt to describe a real-world analogy. Remember that a class 
definition contains the blueprint for objects instantiated from that class. </p>
<p>A certain large construction company is in the business of building 
condominium projects. This contractor builds condos of many different sizes, 
types, and price ranges. However, each different condo project contains condos 
of only two or three different types or price ranges. </p>
<p><strong>A library of blueprints</strong> </p>
<p>There is a large library of blueprints at the contractor&#39;s central office. 
This library contains blueprints for all of the different types of condos that 
the contractor has built or is building. <em>(This library is analogous to the 
class libraries available to the Java programmer.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>A subset from the blueprint library</strong> </p>
<p>When a condo project begins, the contractor delivers copies of several sets 
of blueprints to the construction site. The blueprints delivered to that site 
describe only the types of condos being constructed on that site. </p>
<p><strong>Condo is analogous to an object</strong> </p>
<p>Each condo unit is analogous to an <em>ordinary Java object</em>. </p>
<p>Each set of blueprints delivered to the construction site is roughly 
analogous to an <em>object of the class named <strong>Class</strong>.</em> In 
other words, each set of blueprints describes one or more condo units 
constructed from that set of blueprints. </p>
<p><strong>When construction is complete</strong> </p>
<p>When the construction project is complete, the contractor delivers a set of 
blueprints for each type of condo unit to the management firm that has been 
hired to manage the condo complex. Each set of blueprints continues to be 
analogous to an object of the class named <strong>Class</strong>. The blueprints 
remain at the site of the condo units. </p>
<p><strong>RTTI</strong> </p>
<p>Thus, information regarding the construction, wiring, plumbing, air 
conditioning, etc., for each condo unit <em>(object)</em> continues to be 
available at the site even after the construction has been completed. <em>(This 
is somewhat analogous to something called runtime type information and often 
abbreviated as RTTI. A Class object contains RTTI for objects instantiated from 
that class.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>What are those analogies again?</strong> </p>
<p>In the above scenario, each condo unit is <em>(roughly)</em> analogous to an 
object instantiated from a specific class <em>(set of blueprints).</em> </p>
<p>Each set of blueprints remaining onsite after construction is complete is 
roughly analogous to a <strong>Class</strong> object that describes the 
characteristics of one or more condo units. </p>
<p><strong>What do you care?</strong> </p>
<p>Until you get involved in such advanced topics as <em>reflection</em> and <em>
introspection</em>, you don&#39;t usually have much involvement or much interest in
<strong>Class</strong> objects. They are created automatically, and are 
primarily used by the Java virtual machine during runtime to help it do the 
things that it needs to do. </p>
<p><strong>An exception to that rule</strong> </p>
<p>However, there is one area where you will be interested in the use of these
<strong>Class</strong> objects from early on. You will be interested whenever 
variables or methods in the class definition are declared to be <strong>static</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>Class variables and class methods</strong> </p>
<p>According to the current jargon, declaring a member variable to be <strong>
static</strong> causes it to be a <em>class variable</em>. <em>(Note that local 
variables cannot be declared <strong>static</strong>. Only member variables can 
be declared <strong>static</strong>.)</em> Similarly, declaring a method to be
<strong>static</strong> causes it to be a <em>class method.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Instance variables and methods</strong> </p>
<p>On the other hand, according to the current jargon, not declaring a variable 
to be <strong>static</strong> causes it to be an <em>instance variable</em>, and 
not declaring a method to be <strong>static</strong> causes it to be an <em>
instance method</em>. </p>
<p>In general, we can refer to them as <em>class members</em> and <em>instance 
members</em>. </p>
<p><strong>What is the difference?</strong> </p>
<p>Here are some of the differences between <em>class</em> and <em>instance</em> 
members insofar as this discussion is concerned. </p>
<p><strong>How many copies of member variables exist?</strong> </p>
<p>Every object instantiated from a given class has its own copy of each <em>
instance variable</em> defined in the class. <em>(Instance variables are not 
shared among objects.)</em> However, every object instantiated from a given 
class shares the same copy of each <em>class variable</em> defined in the class.
<em>(It is as though the class variable belongs to the single <strong>Class</strong> 
object and not to the individual objects instantiated from that class.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Access to an instance variable</strong> </p>
<p>Every object has its own copy of each instance variable <em>(the object owns 
the instance variable).</em> Therefore, the only way that you can access an 
instance variable is to use that object&#39;s reference to send a message to the 
object requesting access to the variable <em>(even then, you may not be given 
access, depending on access modifiers).</em> </p>
<p><strong>Why call it an instance variable?</strong> </p>
<p>According to the current jargon, <em><strong>an object is an instance of a 
class</strong>.</em> <em>(I probably told you that somewhere before in this 
Ebook.)</em> Each object has its own copy of each non-static variable. 
Hence, they are often called instance variables. <em>(Every instance of the 
class owns one and they are not implicitly shared among instances.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Access to a class variable</strong> </p>
<p>You can also send a message to an object requesting access to a class 
variable that the object shares with other objects instantiated from the same 
class. <em>(Again, you may or may not gain access, depending the access 
modifiers).</em> </p>
<p><strong>Access using the Class object</strong> </p>
<p>More important, however, you can also access a class variable without a requirement 
to go through an object instantiated from the class. <em>(In fact, a class 
variable can be accessed in the total absence of objects of that class.)</em>
<em>(Remember, this discussion is conceptual in nature, and may not represent an 
actual implementation.)</em> </p>
<p>Assuming that a class variable is otherwise accessible, you can access the 
class variable by sending an access request message to the <strong>Class</strong> 
object to which the variable belongs. </p>
<p><strong>One way to think of this</strong> </p>
<p>To help you keep track of things in a message-passing sense, you can pretend 
that there is a global reference variable whose name is the same as the name of 
a class. </p>
<p>This <em>(hypothetical)</em> reference variable contains a reference to the
<strong>Class</strong> object that owns the class variable. Using standard Java 
message-passing syntax, you can access the class variable by joining the name of 
the reference variable to the name of the class variable with a period. Example 
syntax is shown below: </p>
<div class="a">

<pre>ReferenceVariableName.ClassVariableName</pre>
</div><p>As a result of the hypothetical substitution process that I described above, 
this is equivalent to the following: </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>ClassName.ClassVariableName</pre>
</div>

<p>We will see an example of this in the sample program that I will discuss 
later. </p>
<p><strong><em>Be careful with this thought process</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>While this thought process may be useful when thinking about <strong>static</strong> 
variables and methods, I want to point out, that the thought process breaks down 
very quickly when dealing with <strong>Class</strong> objects in a deeper sense.</em>
</p>
<p><em>For example, when calling the <strong>getName</strong> method on a
<strong>Class</strong> object, an actual reference of type <strong>Class</strong> 
is required to access the members of the <strong>Class</strong> object. The name 
of the class will not suffice.</em> </p>
<p><em>If this discussion of a global reference variable whose name matches the 
name of the class is confusing to you, just forget it. Simply remember that you 
can access class variables by joining the name of the class to the name of the 
class variable using a period as the joining operator.</em> </p>
<p><strong>
Characteristics of class methods</strong> </p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to talk very much about instance methods and class methods in 
this chapter. However, there are a couple of characteristics of class methods 
that deserve a brief discussion in this context. </p>
<p><strong>Cannot access instance members</strong> </p>
<p>First, the code in a class method has direct access only to other <strong>
static</strong> members of the class. <em>(A class method does not have direct 
access to instance variables or instance methods of the class.)</em> This is 
sort of like saying that a class method has access to the methods and variables 
belonging to the <strong>Class</strong> object, but does not have access to the 
methods and variables belonging to the <em>ordinary objects</em> instantiated 
from the class described by the <strong>Class</strong> object.</p>
<p><strong><em>Once 
again, be careful</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Once again, this thinking breaks down very quickly once you get beyond 
<strong>static</strong> members. A <strong>Class</strong> object also has instance methods, such 
as <strong>getName</strong>, which can only be accessed using an actual 
reference to the <strong>Class</strong> object.</em> </p>
<p><em>Now you are probably beginning to understand why I deferred this 
discussion until after I finished discussing the easy stuff.</em> </p>
<p><strong>No 
object required</strong> </p>
<p>Another important characteristic is that a class method can be accessed 
without a requirement for an object of the class to exist. </p>
<p>As with class variables, class methods can be accessed by joining the name of 
the class to the name of the method with a period. </p>
<p>I will illustrate much of this with a sample program named <strong>MyClass01</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>Discuss in fragments</strong> </p>
<p>I will discuss the program in fragments. You will find a complete listing of 
the program in <a href="#Listing_13">Listing 13</a> near the end of the chapter. </p>
<p><a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> shows the beginning of the class definition. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. Beginning of the class 
				named MyClass01.</p>
<pre>class MyClass01{
 static Date v1 = new Date();
 Date v2 = new Date();</pre>
</div>


	<p><strong>Two member variables</strong> </p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> declares two member variables, 
named <strong>v1</strong> and <strong>v2</strong>, and initializes each of those 
variables with a reference to a new object of the <strong>Date</strong> class.
<em>(When instantiated using the constructor with no arguments, the new <strong>
Date</strong> object encapsulates the current date and time from the system 
clock.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Note the static keyword</strong> </p>
<p>The important thing to note here is the use of the <strong>static</strong> 
keyword when declaring the variable named <strong>v1</strong>. This causes
<strong>v1</strong> to be a <em>class variable</em>, exhibiting the 
characteristics of class variables described earlier. </p>
<p><strong>An instance variable</strong> </p>
<p>On the other hand, the variable named <strong>v2</strong> is not declared
<strong>static</strong>. This causes it to be an <em>instance variable</em>, as 
described above. </p>
<p><strong>The main method is a class method</strong> </p>
<p><a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> shows the signature for the <strong>main</strong> method. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. Signature of the main 
				method.</p>
<pre>public static void main(String[] args){</pre>
</div>	<p>The important thing to note here is that the <strong>main</strong> method 
	is declared <strong>static</strong>. That causes it to be a <em>class method</em>.
</p>
<p>As a result, the <strong>main</strong> method can be called without a 
requirement for an object of the class to exist. <em>(Also, the main method has 
direct access only to other <strong>static</strong> members.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>How a Java application starts running</strong> </p>
<p>In fact, that is how the Java Virtual Machine starts an application running.
</p>
<p>First the JVM finds the specified file having an extension of<strong><em> 
.class.</em></strong> Then it examines that file to see if it has a <strong>main</strong> 
method with the correct signature. If not, an error occurs. </p>
<p>If the JVM finds a <strong>main</strong> method with the correct signature, 
it calls that method without instantiating an object of the class. That is how 
the Java Virtual Machine causes a Java application to start running. </p>
<p><strong>A poor programming technique</strong> </p>
<p>Basically, this entire sample program is coded inside the <strong>main</strong> 
method. As a practical manner, this is a very poor programming technique, but it 
works well for this example. <em>(I also used this approach in the early 
chapters in this Ebook in order to minimize the use of objects.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Display some text</strong> </p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a>, which is the first executable statement in the <strong>
main</strong> method, causes the words <strong>Static variable</strong> to 
appear on the computer screen. I will come back and discuss the details of this 
and similar statements later in the chapter. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. Display some text.</p>
<pre> System.out.println("Static variable");</pre>
</div>	<p><strong>Display date information</strong> </p>
<p>Continuing with the code in the <strong>main</strong> method, the 
code in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> causes the current contents of the <strong>Date</strong> 
object referred to by the contents of the class variable named <strong>v1</strong> 
to be displayed on the computer screen. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. Display date information.

				
</p>

				
<pre> System.out.println(MyClass01.v1);</pre>
</div>	<p><strong>No object required</strong> </p>
<p>For the moment, concentrate on the text inside the parentheses in the 
statement in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. </p>
<p>Because the variable named <strong>v1</strong> is 
a class variable, it&#39;s value is accessed by joining the name of the class to the 
name of the variable with a period. </p>
<p><strong>What was the output?</strong> </p>
<p>I will discuss the remaining portion of statements of this sort later. For 
now, just be aware that the code in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> caused 
the output shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a> to be displayed on my 
computer screen when I ran the program.</p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. Output date and time.</p>
<pre>Mon Sep 17 09:52:27 CDT 2001</pre>
</div>


</div>
	<p><strong>Displays date and time</strong> </p>
<p>The date and time displayed will depend on when you run the 
program. As you can see, I first wrote this chapter and ran this program in 2001.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to the seconds portion of the time. I will refer 
back to this later. </p>
<p><strong>A five-second delay</strong> </p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> <em>(still in the <strong>main</strong> method)</em> 
causes the main thread of the program to go to sleep for five seconds. Don&#39;t 
worry about it if you don&#39;t understand this code. The only reason that I 
included it in the program was to force a five-second delay in the execution of 
the program. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. A five-second delay.
				
</p>
				
<pre> try{
  Thread.currentThread().sleep(5000);
 }catch(InterruptedException e){}</pre>
</div>	<p><strong>Instantiate a new object</strong> </p>
<p>Having caused the program to sleep for five seconds, the code in 
<a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> 
instantiates a new object of the class named <strong>MyClass01</strong>. This 
code stores the new object&#39;s reference in the reference variable named <strong>
ref1</strong>. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_6">Listing 6</a>. Instantiate a new object
.
				
</p>
				
<pre> MyClass01 ref1 = new MyClass01();</pre>
</div>	<p><strong>A new Date object also</strong> </p>
<p>Recall from <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> above that the class declares 
an instance variable named <strong>v2</strong> of the type <strong>Date</strong>. </p>
<p>When the new object is instantiated by the code in <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a>, 
a new <strong>Date</strong> object is also instantiated. A reference to that 
object is stored in the instance variable named <strong>v2</strong>. <em>(In 
other words, the new object of the class <strong>MyClass01</strong> owns a 
reference to a new object of the class <strong>Date</strong>. That reference is 
stored in an instance variable named <strong>v2</strong> in the new <strong>
MyClass01</strong> object.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Display the new Date object</strong> </p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> causes a textual representation of the new <strong>Date</strong> 
object referred to by the reference variable named <strong>v2</strong> belonging 
to the object referred to by the reference variable named <strong>ref1</strong>, 
to be displayed on the standard output device. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_7">Listing 7</a>. Display the new Date object .</p>
<pre> System.out.println(ref1.v2);</pre>
</div>	<p><strong>Five seconds later</strong> </p>
<p>This code caused the date and time shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a> to appear on the 
computer screen when I ran the program: </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_2">Figure 2</a>. Five seconds later.


							
</p>


							
<pre>Mon Sep 17 09:52:32 CDT 2001</pre>
</div>


</div>
	<p>The date and time shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a> is five 
	seconds later than the time reflected in the <strong>Date</strong> object 
	referred to by the <em>class variable</em> named <strong>v1</strong> <em>(see
	<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>)</em>. That time was displayed by the code 
	in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> earlier. </p>
<p><strong>So, what does this mean?</strong> </p>
<p>It means that the <strong>Date</strong> object referred to by the <strong>
static</strong> reference variable named <strong>v1</strong> was created five 
seconds earlier than the <strong>Date</strong> object referred to by the 
instance variable named <strong>v2</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>When is a class variable created?</strong> </p>
<p>I can&#39;t tell you precisely when a class variable comes into existence. All I 
can say is that the virtual machine brings it into existence as soon as it is 
needed. </p>
<p>My guess is that it comes into existence at the first mention <em>(in the 
program)</em> of the class to which it belongs. </p>
<p><strong>When is an instance variable created?</strong> </p>
<p>An instance variable doesn&#39;t come into existence until the object to which it 
belongs is created. <em>(An instance variable cannot exist until the object to 
which it belongs exists.)</em> </p>
<p>If the instance variable is initialized with a reference to a new object <em>
(such as a new <strong>Date</strong> object in this sample program),</em> that 
new object comes into existence when the object to which it belongs comes into 
existence. </p>
<p><strong>A five-second delay</strong> </p>
<p>In this program, I purposely inserted a five-second delay between the first 
mention of the class named <strong>MyClass01</strong> in <a href="#Listing_4">
Listing 4</a>, and the instantiation of the object of the class named <strong>
MyClass01</strong> in <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a>. </p>
<p>As a result, the <strong>Date</strong> object referred to by the instance 
variable named <strong>v2</strong> was created about five seconds later than the
<strong>Date</strong> object referred to by the class variable named <strong>v1</strong>.
</p>
<p>This is reflected in the date and time values displayed and discussed above.
</p>
<p><strong>Accessing class variable via an object</strong> </p>
<p>While it is possible to access a class variable using the name of the class 
joined to the name of the variable, it is also possible to access a class 
variable using a reference to any object instantiated from the class. </p>
<p><em>(As mentioned earlier, if two or more objects are instantiated from the 
same class, they share the same class variable.)</em> </p>
<p>The code in parentheses in <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> uses the reference variable named <strong>ref1</strong> 
to access the class variable named <strong>v1</strong>, and to cause the 
contents of the <strong>Date</strong> object referred to by the class variable 
to be displayed. </p>
<div class="a">

<pre> System.out.println(ref1.v1);</pre>

<p>This caused the date and time shown in <a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a> to be displayed on my

</div>


</div>
	<p><strong>Same date and time as before</strong> </p>
<p>As you have probably already surmised, this is the same date and time shown 
earlier in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. This is because the code in
<a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> refers to the same class variable as the code 
in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. </p>
<p>Nothing has caused the contents of that class variable to change, so both
<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a> display 
the contents of the same <strong>Date</strong> object. </p>
<p><em>(Only one class variable exists and it doesn&#39;t matter how you access it. 
Either way, you gain access to the same <strong>Date</strong> object whose 
reference is stored in the class variable. Thus, the same date and time is shown 
in both cases.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Another new object</strong> </p>
<p>If you examine the code in <a href="#Listing_13">Listing 13</a> near the end 
of the program, you will see that an additional five-second delay is introduced 
at this point in the program. </p>
<p>Following that delay, the code in <a href="#Listing_9">Listing 9</a> 
instantiates another new object of the class named <strong>MyClass01</strong>, and stores the object&#39;s reference 
in a new reference variable named <strong>ref2</strong>. </p>
<p><em>(The object 
referred to by <strong>ref1</strong> is a different object than the object 
referred to by <strong>ref2</strong>. Each object has its own instance variable 
named <strong>v2</strong>, and in this case, each instance variable is 
initialized to instantiate and refer to a new <strong>Date</strong> object when 
the new <strong>MyClass01</strong> object is instantiated.)</em> </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_9">Listing 9</a>. Another new object. </p>
				
<pre> MyClass01 ref2 = new MyClass01();</pre>
</div>	<p><strong>Display the date and time</strong> </p>
<p>Then, the code in <a href="#Listing_10">Listing 10</a> causes the contents of the <strong>Date</strong> 
object referred to by the instance variable named <strong>v2</strong> in the 
second object of the class named <strong>MyClass01 </strong>to be displayed. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_10">Listing 10</a>. Display the date and time
.
				
</p>
				
<pre> System.out.println(ref2.v2);</pre>
</div>	<p>This caused the output shown in <a href="#Figure_4">Figure 4</a> to be displayed on my computer 
	screen when I ran the program.</p>
<p><em>(Once again, you will get different results if 
	you compile and run the program because the date and time shown is the date 
	and time that you run the program.)</em> </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_4">Figure 4</a>. A new date and time.</p>
<pre>Mon Sep 17 09:52:37 CDT 2001</pre>
</div>


</div>
	<p><strong>Five seconds later</strong> </p>
<p>As you have probably figured out by now, the time encapsulated in this
<strong>Date</strong> object is five seconds later than the time encapsulated in 
the <strong>Date</strong> object displayed in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>. 
This is because the program was put to sleep for five seconds between the 
instantiation of the two objects referred to by <strong>ref1</strong> and <strong>ref2</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Every object has one</strong> </p>
<p>Every object instantiated from a given class has its own copy of each 
instance variable declared in the class definition. There is no sharing of 
instance variables among objects. </p>
<p>Each instance variable comes into existence when the object to which it 
belongs comes into existence, and ceases to exist when the object to which it 
belongs ceases to exist. </p>
<p><strong><em>Eligible for garbage collection</em></strong></p>
<p><em>If the instance variables are reference variables holding references to 
other objects, as is the case here, and if there are no other reference 
variables holding references to those same objects, the secondary objects cease 
to exist when the primary objects cease to exist.</em></p>
<p><em>Technically, the objects may not actually cease to exist. Technically 
they become eligible for garbage collection, which means that the memory that 
they occupy becomes eligible for reuse. However, as a practical matter, they 
cease to exist insofar as the program is concerned because they are no longer 
accessible.</em></p>
<p><strong>A five-second difference in the time of creation</strong></p>
<p>Since the two objects referred to by <strong>ref1</strong> and <strong>ref2</strong> 
came into existence with a five-second delay, the <strong>Date</strong> objects 
belonging to those two object reflect a five-second difference in the time 
encapsulated in the objects. </p>
<p><strong>Only one copy of class variable exists</strong> </p>
<p>Also remember that if a variable is a class variable, only one copy of the 
variable exists, and all objects instantiated from the class share that one 
copy. </p>
<p>This is illustrated by the code in <a href="#Listing_11">Listing 11</a>, which uses the reference to 
the second object instantiated from the class named <strong>MyClass01</strong>, 
to cause the contents of the class variable named <strong>v1</strong> to be 
displayed. </p>

	
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_11">Listing 11</a>. Display date 
				information.
				
</p>
				
<pre>  System.out.println(ref2.v1);
 }//end main</pre>
</div>	<p>The output produced by the code in <a href="#Listing_11">Listing 11</a> is shown in 
	<a href="#Figure_5">Figure 5</a>. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_5">Figure 5</a>. Same date and time as

</p>


							
<pre>Mon Sep 17 09:52:27 CDT 2001</pre>
</div>


</div>
	<p><strong>Same output as before</strong> </p>
<p>As you can see, this is the same as the output shown in <a href="#Figure_1">
Figure 1</a> and <a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a> earlier. </p>
<p><strong>Accessing the same physical class variable</strong> </p>
<p>Since only one class variable named <strong>v1</strong> exists, and all 
objects instantiated from the class named <strong>MyClass01</strong> share that 
single copy, it doesn&#39;t matter whether you access the class variable using the 
name of the class, or access it using a reference to either of the objects 
instantiated from the class. In all three cases, you are accessing the same 
physical class variable. </p>
<p>Since nothing was done to cause the contents of the class variable to change 
after it came into existence and was initialized, <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>,
<a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a>, and <a href="#Figure_5">Figure 5</a> are 
simply three different displays of the date and time encapsulated in the same
<strong>Date</strong> object whose reference is stored in the class variable. </p>
<p><strong>Let&#39;s revisit System.out.println...</strong> </p>
<p>Now, I want to revisit the statement originally shown in <a href="#Listing_8">
Listing 8</a> and repeated in <a href="#Listing_12">Listing 
12</a> for viewing convenience. </p>

</div>	<p><strong>Java programmer wanted</strong> </p>
<p>I sometimes tell my students that if I were out in industry interviewing 
prospective Java programmers, my first question would be to ask the prospective 
employee to tell me everything that she knows about the statement in <a href="#Listing_12">Listing 
12</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Covers a lot of Java OOP technology</strong> </p>
<p>This is not because there is a great demand for the use of this statement in 
real-world problems. <em>(In fact, in a GUI-driven software product world, there 
is probably very little demand for the use of this statement.)</em> Rather, it 
is because a lot of Java object-oriented technology is embodied in this single 
statement. </p>
<p>In that scenario, I would expect to receive a verbal dissertation of fifteen 
to twenty minutes in length to cover all the important points. </p>
<p><strong>The short version</strong> </p>
<p>Let me give you the short version. There is a class named <strong>System</strong>. 
The <strong>System</strong> class declares three <strong>static</strong> <em>
(class)</em> variables having the following types, names, and modifiers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>public static final PrintStream <strong>out</strong></li>
	<li>public static final InputStream <strong>in</strong></li>
	<li>public static final PrintStream <strong>err</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>(Note that these class variables are also declared <strong>final</strong>, 
causing them to behave as constants.)</em> </p>
<p>A<strong>ccess the out variable 
without an object</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>out</strong> is a class variable, <strong>System.out</strong> 
returns the contents of the class variable named <strong>out </strong><em>(an 
object of the <strong>System</strong> class is not required in order to access a class variable 
of the <strong>System</strong> class).</em> </p>
<p>In general, <em>(ignoring the possibility of subclasses and interfaces)</em> 
because <strong>out</strong> is a reference variable of type <strong>PrintStream</strong>, 
the returned value must either be <strong>null</strong> <em>(no object 
reference)</em> or a reference to a valid <strong>PrintStream</strong> object.
</p>
<p><strong>Object of the PrintStream class</strong> </p>
<p>When the Java Virtual Machine starts an application running, it automatically instantiates 
an object of the <strong>PrintStream</strong> class and connects it to the
<strong>standard output device</strong>. <em>(By default, the standard output 
device is typically the computer screen, but it can be redirected at the 
operating system level to be some other device. The following discussion assumes 
that the screen is the standard output device.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Assign object&#39;s 
reference to out variable</strong> </p>
<p>When the <strong>PrintStream</strong> object is instantiated by the virtual 
machine, the object&#39;s reference is assigned to the class variable of the <strong>
System</strong> class named <strong>out</strong>. <em>(Because the variable 
named <strong>out</strong> is final, the contents of the variable cannot be 
modified later.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Reference to a PrintStream object</strong> </p>
<p>Therefore, the expression <strong>System.out</strong> returns a reference to 
the <strong>PrintStream</strong> object, which is connected to the standard 
output device. </p>
<p><strong>Many instance methods</strong> </p>
<p>An object of the <strong>PrintStream</strong> class contains many instance 
methods. This includes numerous overloaded versions of a method named <strong>
println</strong>. The signature of one of those overloaded 
<a name="versions_of_the_println_method_follows">versions of the
<strong>println</strong> method follows</a>: </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>public void println(Object x)</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Textual representation of an object </strong> </p>
<p>The purpose of this overloaded version of the <strong>println</strong> method 
is to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a textual representation of the object referred to by the 
	incoming parameter of type <strong>Object </strong><em>(because <strong>
	Object</strong> is a totally generic type, this version of the <strong>
	println</strong> method can accept an incoming parameter that is a reference 
	to any type of object)</em></li>
	<li>Send that textual representation to the output device</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In general...</strong></p>
<p>A new <strong>PrintStream</strong> object can be connected to a variety of output devices when 
it is instantiated. However, in the special case of the <strong>PrintStream</strong> 
object instantiated by the virtual machine when the program starts, whose 
reference is stored in the class variable named <strong>out</strong> of the
<strong>System</strong> class, the purpose of the object is to provide a display 
path to the standard output device. </p>
<p><strong>Our old friend, the toString method</strong> </p>
<p>To accomplish this, the code in the version of the <strong>println</strong> method shown
<a href="#versions_of_the_println_method_follows">above</a> calls the
<strong>toString</strong> method on the incoming reference. <em>(I discussed the
<strong>toString</strong> method in detail in earlier chapters in this 
Ebook.)</em> The <strong>toString</strong> method may, or may not, have 
been overridden in the definition of the class from which the object was 
instantiated, or in some superclass of the class from which the object was 
instantiated. </p>
<p><strong>Default version of toString</strong> </p>
<p>If not overridden, the default version of the <strong>toString</strong> 
method defined in the <strong>Object</strong> class is used to produce a textual 
representation of the object. As we learned in an earlier chapter, that textual 
representation looks something like the following: </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>ClassName@HexHashCode</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Overridden version of toString method</strong> </p>
<p>If the class from which the object was instantiated <em>(or some superclass 
of that class)</em> contains an overridden version of the <strong>toString</strong> 
method, runtime polymorphism kicks in and the overridden version of the method 
is executed to produce the textual representation of the object. </p>
<p><strong>The Date class overrides toString</strong> </p>
<p>In the case of this sample program, the object was instantiated from the
<strong>Date</strong> class. The <strong>Date</strong> class does override the
<strong>toString</strong> method. </p>
<p>When the overridden <strong>toString</strong> method is called on a <strong>
Date</strong> object&#39;s reference, the <strong>String</strong> returned by the 
method looks something like that shown in <a href="#Figure_6">Figure 6</a>. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_6">Figure 6</a>. Output from overridden 
				toString method in Date class.</p>

</div>


</div>
	<p>You will recall that this is the output that was produced by the code 
	shown in <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> and <a href="#Listing_12">
	Listing 12</a>. </p>
<p><strong>More than you ever wanted to know ...</strong> </p>
<p>And that is probably more than you ever wanted to know about the expression
<strong>System.out.println...</strong>. </p>
<p>It is also probably more than you ever wanted to know about class variables, 
class methods, instance variables, and instance methods. </p>
<p><strong>Some cautions</strong> </p>
<p>Before leaving this topic, I do want to express some cautions. Basically, I 
want to suggest that you use <em><strong>static</strong></em> members very sparingly, if at all.
</p>
<p><strong>Static variables</strong> </p>
<p>To begin with, don&#39;t ever use <strong>static</strong> variables without 
declaring them <strong>final</strong> unless you understand exactly why you are declaring them <strong>static</strong>.
</p>
<p><em>(<strong>static</strong> <strong>final</strong> variables, or constants, are often very 
appropriate. See the fields in the <strong>Color</strong> class for example.)</em>
</p>
<p>I can think of only a very a few situations in which the use of a 
non-final <strong>static</strong> variable might be appropriate. </p>
<p><em>(One appropriate use might be to count the number of objects instantiated 
from a specific class.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Static methods</strong> </p>
<p>Don&#39;t declare methods <strong>static</strong> if there is any requirement for 
the method to remember anything from one call to the next. </p>
<p>There are many appropriate uses for <strong>static</strong> methods, but in 
most cases, the purpose of the method will be to completely perform some action 
with no requirement to remember anything from that call to the next. </p>
<p>The method should probably also be self-contained. By this I mean that all 
information that the method needs to do its job should either come from incoming 
parameters or from <strong>final</strong> <strong>static</strong> member 
variables <em>(constants).</em> The method probably should not depend on the 
values stored in non-final <strong>static</strong> member variables, which are subject to change 
over time.</p>
<p><em>(A <strong>static</strong> method only has access to other <strong>static</strong> members of the class, so 
it cannot depend on instance variables defined in the class.)</em> </p>
<p>An appropriate example of a <strong>static</strong> method is the <strong>sqrt </strong>method 
of the <strong>Math</strong> class. This method computes and <em>&quot;Returns the 
correctly rounded positive square root of a double&quot;</em> where the <strong>double</strong> value 
is provided as a parameter to the method. Each time the method is called, it 
completes its task and doesn&#39;t attempt to save any values from that call to the 
next. Furthermore, it gets all the information that it needs to do its job from 
an incoming parameter.</p>
	<h1 class="style1"><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p><strong>Added complexity</strong></p>
<p>The existence of <strong>static</strong> members tends to break up the simple OOP structures 
that I have discussed in previous chapters in this Ebook. </p>
<p>While <strong>static</strong> members can be useful in some situations, the existence of 
<strong>static</strong> members tends to complicate the overall object-oriented structure of 
Java. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the overuse of <strong>static</strong> members can lead to problems similar to 
those experienced in languages like C and C++ that support global variables and 
global functions. </p>
<p><strong>The class named Class</strong> </p>
<p>I discussed the class named <strong>Class</strong> and how a <em>conceptual</em> 
object of type <strong>Class</strong> exists in memory following a reference to 
a specific class in the program code. </p>
<p>The <strong>Class</strong> object represents the referenced class in memory, 
and contains the <strong>static</strong> variables and <strong>static</strong> methods belonging to that class.
<em>(It contains some other information as well, such as the name of the 
superclass.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Class members and instance members</strong> </p>
<p><em>Class variables</em> and <em>class methods</em> are declared <strong>static</strong> <em>(declaring a member 
<strong>static</strong> in the class definition causes to be called a class member)</em>. </p>
<p>Instance variables and instance methods are not declared <strong>static</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Each object has its own copy ...</strong> </p>
<p>Every object instantiated from a given class has its own copy of each 
instance variable declared in the class definition. <em>(Instance variables are 
not shared among objects.)</em> </p>
<p>Every object instantiated from a given class acts like it has its own copy of 
every instance method declared in the class definition. <em>(Apparently instance 
methods are physically shared among objects in order to reduce the amount of 
memory required, but they are shared in such a way that they don&#39;t appear to be 
shared.)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Every object shares ...</strong> </p>
<p>Every object instantiated from a given class shares the same single copy of 
each class variable declared in the class definition. Similarly, every object 
instantiated from a given class shares the same copy of each class method. </p>
<p><strong>Accessing an instance member</strong> </p>
<p>An instance variable or an instance method can only be accessed by using a 
reference to the object that owns it. Even then, it may or may not be accessible 
depending on the access modifier assigned by the programmer. </p>
<p><strong>Accessing a class member</strong> </p>
<p>The single shared copy of a class variable or a class method can be accessed 
in either of two ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Via a reference to any object instantiated from the class.</li>
	<li>By simply joining the name of the class to the name of the class 
	variable or the class method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, the variable or method may or may not be accessible, depending on the 
access modifiers assigned by the programmer.</p>
<p><strong>When to use class variables</strong> </p>
<p>It is very often appropriate to use <strong>final</strong> <strong>static</strong> variables, as constants in 
your programs. It is rarely, if ever, appropriate to use non-final <strong>static</strong> 
variables in your programs. The use of non-final <strong>static</strong> variables should 
definitely be minimized. </p>
<p><strong>When to use <strong>static</strong> methods</strong> </p>
<p>It is often appropriate to use <strong>static</strong> methods in your programs, provided 
there is no requirement for the method to remember anything from one call to the 
next. <strong>Static</strong> methods should be self-contained.</p>
