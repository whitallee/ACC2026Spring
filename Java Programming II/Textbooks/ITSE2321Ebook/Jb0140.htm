<p>This chapter is part of an Ebook designed to help you learn 
to program computers. </p>
<p>It explains Java comments.</p>
<blockquote><em>Hopefully you have already been introduced to comments in the 
Kjell </em><a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap06/ch06_15.html"><em>
book</em></a><em>. If not, I recommend that you review that material before 
continuing with this chapter.</em></blockquote>
<h2><a name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>The minimum prerequisites for understanding the material in these chapters 
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An understanding of algebra.</li>
	<li>An understanding of all of the material covered in the earlier chapters 
	in this Ebook.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Comments">Comments</a></h2>
<p>The process of writing and using a Java program consists of the following steps:

    </p>
<ol>
	<li>Write the source code. </li>
	<li>Compile the source code.
    </li>
	<li>Execute the program.

</li>
</ol>
<p>The source code consists of a set of instructions that will later be presented to a special program called a compiler for the purpose of producing a program that can be executed.  In other words, when you write the source code, you are writing instructions that the compiler will use to produce the executable program. </p>
<h3>Some things should be ignored

</h3>
<p>Sometimes, when you are writing source code, you would like to include information that may be useful to you, but should be ignored by the compiler.  Information of that sort is called 
a 
<strong>comment</strong>. </p>
<h3>Three styles of comments</h3>
<p>Java supports the three styles of comments shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.</p>


<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. Three styles of comments.
</p>
<pre>
/** special documentation comment 
used by the javadoc tool */

/* This is a 
multi-line comment */

//Single-line comment
program code // Another single-line comment</pre></div>



	
<h3>The javadoc tool</h3>
<p>The javadoc tool mentioned in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a> is a special program that is used to produce documentation for Java programs.  Comments of this style begin with /** and end with */ as shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
<p>The compiler ignores everything in the source code that begins and ends with this pattern of characters.

Documentation produced using the javadoc program is very useful for on-line or 
on-screen documentation.</p>
<h3>Multi-line comments</h3>
<p>Multi-line comments begin with /* and end with */ as shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.  As you have probably already guessed, the compiler also ignores everything in the source code that matches this format.
<em>(A javadoc comment is simply a multi-line comment insofar as the compiler 
knows. Only the special program named javadoc.exe cares about javadoc comments.)</em></p>
<p>The multi-line comment style is particularly useful for creating large blocks of information that should be ignored by the compiler.  
This style can be used to produce a comment consisting of a single line of text as well.  However, the single-line comment style discussed in the next section requires less typing. </p>
<h3>Single-line comments</h3>
<p>Single-line comments begin with // and end at the end of the line.  The compiler  ignores the // and everything following 
the slash characters to the end of the line.</p>
<p>This style is particularly useful for inserting short comments throughout the source code.  In this case, the // can appear at the beginning of the line 
as shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>, or can appear anywhere in the line, including at the end of some valid source code
<em>(also shown in </em> <a href="#Figure_1"><em>Figure 1</em></a><em>)</em>. </p>
	

<h2><a name="Sample_program">Sample program</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of the program named <strong>Comments01</strong>, which is shown in
<a href="#Listing_3">Listing 
3</a> near the end of the chapter, is to illustrate the use of single and multi-line comments.  The program does not 
contain any javadoc comments.</p>
<p>The commands for a batch file that you can use to compile and run this 
program are provided in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a>.</p>
<p>When you compile and run the program, the following text should appear on your 
command-line screen:</p>
<pre>Hello World </pre>
<h3><a name="Interesting_code_fragments">Interesting code fragments</a></h3>
<p>I will explain this program in fragments, and will explain only those portions of the program that are germane to this 
chapter.  Don't worry about the other details of the program 
at this time.  You will learn about those details in future chapters.</p>
<h4>A multi-line comment</h4>
<p><a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a>, 
shows a multi-line comment, which consists of three lines of text.</p>
<p>As required, this multi-line comment begins with /* and ends with */.  The 
extra stars on the third line are simply part of the comment.</p>
<p>You will often see formats similar to this being used to provide a visual separation between multi-line comments and the other parts of a program. </p>

<div class="a">
<a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. A multi-line comment.

<pre>
/*File Comments01.java
This is a multi-line comment.
*****************************************/
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Single-line comments</h4>
<p><a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> shows three 
single-line comments. Can you spot them? Remember, single-line comments begin 
with //.</p>
<div class="a">
<a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. Three single-line comments.

<pre>
class Comments01 {
  //This is a single-line comment 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
    System.out.println("Hello World"); 
  }//end main 
}//End class</pre>
</div>

<p>One of the comments in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> starts at the 
beginning of the line. The other two comments follow some program code.</p>
<p>A demonstration of javadoc comments is beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="auto-style3"><a name="Run_the_program">Run the program</a></h1>
	<p>I encourage you to run the program that I presented in this chapter 
	to confirm that you get the same results. Experiment with 
the code, making changes, and observing the results of your changes. Make 
certain that you can explain why your changes behave as they do. </p>
<h1 class="style1"><a name="Complete_program_listings">Complete program listings</a></h1>
<p><a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> contains a complete listing of the 
program named <strong>Comments01</strong>.</p>
<div class="a">
<a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. The program named Comments01.

<pre>
/*File Comments01.java
