<p>This chapter discusses the <strong>String</strong> and <strong>StringBuffer</strong> 
classes in detail. This is the first deep dive into OOP in this Ebook, and it 
may contain concepts and terminology that you are not familiar with. Give 
it a shot and try to understand as much as you can. Those concepts and that 
terminology will become more clear as you pursue the second major part of this 
Ebook that concentrates on OOP.</p>

<h1 ><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>A string in Java is an object. Java provides two different string classes from which objects 
that encapsulate string data can be 
instantiated: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>String</strong> </li>
<li><strong>StringBuffer</strong> </li></ul>

<p>The <strong>String</strong> class is used for strings that are not allowed to change 
once an object has been instantiated <em>(an immutable object)</em>. 
The <strong>StringBuffer</strong> class is used for strings that may be modified by the 
program. </p>
<h1 ><a name="YouCant"></a>You can&#39;t modify 
a String object, but you can replace it</h1>
<p>While the contents of a <strong>String</strong> object 
cannot be modified, a reference to a <strong>String</strong> object can be 
caused to point to a different <strong>String</strong> object as illustrated in 
the sample program shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. Sometimes this makes it appear that the 
original <strong>String</strong> object is being modified. </p>
<!--``1List01-->

This application illustrates the fact that while a String 
object cannot be modified, the reference variable can be 
modified to point to a new String object which can have 
the appearance of modifying the original String object.

The program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95.

The output from this program is

Display original string values
THIS STRING IS NAMED str1
This string is named str2
Replace str1 with another string
Display new string named str1
THIS STRING IS NAMED str1 This string is named str2
Terminating program

**********************************************************/

class String01{
  String str1 = &quot;THIS STRING IS NAMED str1&quot;;
  String str2 = &quot;This string is named str2&quot;;
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String01 thisObj = new String01();
    System.out.println(&quot;Display original string values&quot;);
    System.out.println(thisObj.str1);
    System.out.println(thisObj.str2);
    System.out.println(&quot;Replace str1 with another string&quot;);
    thisObj.str1 = thisObj.str1 + &quot; &quot; + thisObj.str2;
    System.out.println(&quot;Display new string named str1&quot;);
    System.out.println(thisObj.str1);
    System.out.println(&quot;Terminating program&quot;);
  }//end main()
}//end class String01
</pre>

</div>
<!--``2-->

<p>It is important to note that the following statement does not modify 
the original object pointed to by the reference variable named <strong>str1</strong>. </p>



<div class="a">
				<pre>
thisObj.str1 = thisObj.str1 + &quot; &quot; + thisObj.str2;</pre>
</div>

<p>Rather, this statement creates a new object, which is concatenation of 
two existing objects and causes the reference variable named <strong>str1</strong> to 
point to the new object instead of the original object. </p>
<p>The original object then becomes eligible for garbage collection <em>(unless 
there is another reference to the object hanging around somewhere)</em>. </p>
<p>Many aspects of string manipulation can be accomplished in this manner, 
particularly when the methods of the <strong>String</strong> class are brought into 
play. </p>
<h1 ><a name="WhyAreThereTwoStringClasses"></a>
Why are there two string classes?</h1>
<p>According to <em>The Java Tutorial</em> by Campione and Walrath:</p>



<div class="a">
				<p>&quot;Because they are constants, Strings are typically cheaper than 
StringBuffers and they can be shared. So it&#39;s important to use Strings 
when they&#39;re appropriate.&quot;</p>
</div>


<h1 ><a name="CreatingStringsandStringBuffers"></a>
Creating String and StringBuffer objects</h1>
<p>The <strong>String</strong> and <strong>StringBuffer</strong> classes have 
numerous overloaded constructors and many different methods. I will attempt to provide a 
sampling of constructors and methods that will prepare you to explore other 
constructors and methods on your own. </p>
<p>The next sample program touches on some of the possibilities provided by the 
wealth of constructors and methods in the <strong>String</strong> and <strong>StringBuffer</strong> 
classes. </p>
<p>At this point, I will refer you to the Java 
documentation. <em>(See the chapter titled Jb0110: Programming Fundamentals, Getting Started.)</em> Among other things, the documentation provides a list of the 
overloaded constructors and methods for the <strong>String</strong> and <strong>
StringBuffer</strong> classes.</p>

<p>As of Java version 7, there are four overloaded constructors in the 
<strong>StringBuffer</strong> class and about thirteen different overloaded versions of the 
<strong>append</strong> 
method. There are many additional methods in the 
<strong>StringBuffer</strong> class including about twelve overloaded versions of the 
<strong>insert</strong> method. </p>
<p>As you can see, there are lots of constructors and lots of methods from which 
to choose. One of your challenges as a Java programmer will be to find the right 
methods of the right classes to accomplish what you want your program 
to accomplish. </p>
<h2 ><a name="FirstSampleProgram"></a>The sample program named String02</h2>
<p>The sample program shown in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> illustrates a variety of ways to create 
and initialize <strong>String</strong> and <strong>StringBuffer</strong> 
objects. </p>



<div class="a">

class String02{
  void d(String displayString){//method to display strings
    System.out.println(displayString);
  }//end method d()

  public static void main(String[] args){
    String02 o = new String02();//obj of controlling class
    
    o.d(&quot;Create a String the long way and display it&quot;);

</div>



<h2 ><a name="AlternativeString"></a>
Alternative String instantiation constructs</h2>
<p>The first thing to notice is that a <strong>String</strong> object can be created 
using either of the following constructs: </p>



<div class="a"><a name="AlternativeString0"></a>
				<strong>Alternative String instantiation constructs</strong>
				<pre>
    String str1 = new String(&quot;String named str2&quot;);
   
    String str2 = &quot;String named str1&quot;;</pre>
</div>

<p>The first approach uses the <strong>new</strong> operator to instantiate an object 
while the shorter version doesn&#39;t use the new operator. </p>
<p>Later I will discuss the fact that </p>
<ul>
	<li>the second approach is not simply a 
shorthand version of the first construct, but that </li>
	<li>they involve two 
different compilation scenarios with the second construct being more efficient 
than the first. </li>
</ul>
<h2 ><a name="InstantiatingStringBufferObjects"></a>
Instantiating StringBuffer objects</h2>
<p>The next thing to notice is that a similar alternative strategy does 
not hold for the <strong>StringBuffer</strong> class. </p>
<p>For example, it is not possible to create a <strong>StringBuffer</strong> object 
without use of the <strong>new</strong> operator. <em>(It is possible to create a reference to 
a </em> <strong><em>StringBuffer</em></strong><em> object but it is later necessary to use the 
<strong>new</strong> 
operator to actually instantiate an object.)</em></p>
<p>Note the following code fragments that illustrate allowable and non-allowable instantiation 
scenarios for <strong>StringBuffer</strong> objects. </p>



<div class="a"><strong>Instantiating StringBuffer objects</strong>
				<pre>
//allowed
StringBuffer str3 = new StringBuffer(
                      &quot;StringBuffer named str3&quot;);

//not allowed     
//StringBuffer str4 = &quot;StringBuffer named str4&quot;;


o.d(&quot;Try to create and append to StringBuffer &quot; +
             &quot;without using new -- not allowed&quot;);
//StringBuffer str7;
//str7.append(&quot;StringBuffer named str7&quot;);</pre>
</div>

<h2 ><a name="DeclarationMemory"></a>
Declaration, memory allocation, and initialization</h2>
<p>To review what you learned in an earlier chapter, three steps are 
normally involved in creating an object <em>(but the third step may be omitted)</em>. </p>

<ul>
<li>declaration </li>
<li>memory allocation </li>
<li>initialization </li></ul>

<p>The following code fragment performs all three steps: </p>



<div class="a"><strong>
				<a name="Declaration_memory_allocation_and_initialization">Declaration, memory allocation, and initialization</a></strong>
				<pre>
StringBuffer str3 = 
  new StringBuffer(&quot;StringBuffer named str3&quot;);</pre>
</div>
<p>The code </p>
<pre>StringBuffer str3 </pre>
<p>declares the type and name 
of a reference variable of the correct type for the benefit of the compiler. </p>
<p>The <strong>new</strong> operator allocates memory for the new object. </p>
<p>The constructor call </p>
<pre>StringBuffer("StringBuffer named str3") </pre>
<p>constructs and 
initializes the object. </p>

<h2 ><a name="InstantiatinganEmpty"></a>
Instantiating an empty StringBuffer object</h2>
<p>The instantiation of the <strong>StringBuffer</strong> object shown 
<a href="#Declaration_memory_allocation_and_initialization">above</a> uses a version of 
the constructor that accepts a <strong>String</strong> object and initializes the 
<strong>StringBuffer</strong> object when it is 
created. </p>
<p>The following code fragment instantiates an empty <strong>StringBuffer</strong> object 
of a default capacity and then uses a version of the <strong>append</strong> method 
to put some data into the object. <em>(Note that the data is actually a <strong>
String</strong> object -- a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation 
marks.)</em></p>



<div class="a"><strong>Instantiating an empty StringBuffer object</strong>
				<pre>
//default initial length
StringBuffer str5 = new StringBuffer();

//modify length as needed
str5.append(&quot;StringBuffer named str5&quot;);</pre>
</div>

<p>It is also possible to specify the capacity when you instantiate a 
<strong>StringBuffer</strong> object. </p>
<p>Some authors suggest that if you know the final length of such an object, it 
is more efficient to specify that length when the object is instantiated than to 
start with the default length and then require the system to increase the length 
&quot;on the fly&quot; as you manipulate the object. </p>
<p>This is illustrated in the following code fragment. This fragment also illustrates the 
use of the <strong>length</strong> method of the <strong>String</strong> class just to make things 
interesting. <em>(A simple integer value for the capacity of the </em> <strong><em>StringBuffer</em></strong><em> 
object would have worked just as well.) </em> </p>



<div class="a"><strong>Instantiating a StringBuffer object of a non-default length</strong>
				<pre>
    StringBuffer str6 = new StringBuffer(
                &quot;StringBuffer named str6&quot;.length());
    str6.append(&quot;StringBuffer named str6&quot;);</pre>
</div>


<h1 ><a name="AccessorMethods"></a>Accessor 
methods</h1>
<p>The following quotation is taken directly from <em>The Java Tutorial</em> by Campione and Walrath. </p>



<div class="a">
				<p>&quot;An object&#39;s instance variables are encapsulated within 
the object, hidden inside, safe from inspection or manipulation by other 
objects. With certain well-defined exceptions, the object&#39;s methods are the 
only means by which other objects can inspect or alter an object&#39;s instance 
variables. Encapsulation of an object&#39;s data protects the object from corruption 
by other objects and conceals an object&#39;s implementation details from outsiders. 
This encapsulation of data behind an object&#39;s methods is one of 
the cornerstones of object-oriented programming.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>The above statement lays out an important consideration in good 
object-oriented programming. </p>
<p>The methods used to obtain information about an object are often referred to 
as <em>accessor methods</em>. There are also known as <em>getter</em> methods, 
as in <em>to get</em> something.</p>
<h2 ><a name="Constructorsand"></a>
Constructors and methods of the String class</h2>
<p>I told you in an <a href="#CreatingStringsandStringBuffers">earlier section</a> that the <strong>StringBuffer</strong> class 
provides a large number of overloaded constructors and methods. The same holds 
true for the <strong>String</strong> class.</p>
<p>Once again, I will refer you to the Java 
documentation. Among other things, the documentation provides a list of the 
overloaded constructors and methods for the <strong>String</strong> class </p>

<h2 ><a name="StringEncapsulatesData"></a>
String objects encapsulate data</h2>
<p>The characters in a <strong>String</strong> object are not directly available to 
other objects. However, as you can see from the documentation, there are a large number of methods 
that can be 
used to access and manipulate those characters. For example, in an 
earlier sample program <em>(</em><a href="#Listing_2"><em>Listing 2</em></a><em>)</em>, 
I used the <strong>length</strong> method to access the 
number of characters stored in a <strong>String</strong> object as shown in the 
following code fragment. </p>
<blockquote><em>(Note here that I am speaking of a <strong>method</strong> named 
length, which is different from the length <strong>property</strong> of an array 
object that you learned about earlier. Recall that there are no parenthesis 
required when you access the length property of an array object.)</em></blockquote>



<div class="a">
				<pre>
StringBuffer str6 = new StringBuffer(
                    &quot;StringBuffer named str6&quot;.length());</pre>
</div>

<p>In this case, I applied the <strong>length</strong> method to a literal string, but 
it can be applied to any valid representation of an object of type 
<strong>String</strong>. </p>
<p>I then passed the value returned by the <strong>length</strong> method to the 
constructor for a <strong>StringBuffer</strong> object. </p>
<p>As you can determine by examining the argument lists for the various methods of 
the <strong>String</strong> class, </p>

<ul>
<li>some methods return data stored in the string while </li>
<li>other methods return information about that data. </li></ul>

<p>For example, the <strong>length</strong> method returns information about the data 
stored in the <strong>String</strong> object. </p>
<p>Methods such as <strong>charAt</strong> and <strong>substring</strong> return portions of 
the actual data. </p>
<p>Methods such <strong>toUpperCase</strong> can be thought of as returning the data, 
but returning it in a different format. </p>

<h2 ><a name="CreatingStringObjectswithout"></a>
Creating String objects without calling the constructor</h2>
<p>Methods in other classes and objects may create <strong>String</strong> objects without an explicit call to 
the constructor by the programmer. For example the <strong>toString</strong> 
method of the <strong>Float</strong> class receives a <strong>float</strong> 
value as an incoming parameter and returns a reference to a <strong>String</strong> 
object that represents the value of the <strong>float</strong> argument. </p>

<h1 ><a name="MemoryManagement"></a>Memory 
management by the StringBuffer class</h1>
<p>If the additional characters cause the size of the <strong>StringBuffer</strong> 
to grow beyond its current capacity when characters are added, additional memory is automatically allocated. </p>
<p>However, memory allocation is a relatively expensive operation and you can 
make your code more efficient by initializing <strong>StringBuffer</strong> 
capacity to a reasonable first guess. This will minimize the number of times 
memory must be allocated for it. </p>
<p>When using the <strong>insert</strong> methods of the <strong>StringBuffer</strong> 
class, you specify the index 
<em>before which</em> you want the data inserted. </p>

<h1 ><a name="ThetoStringMethod"></a>The 
toString method</h1>
<p>Frequently you will need to convert an object of some other type to an object 
of the <strong>String</strong> 
class. For example, this can happen when you need to pass it to a method that accepts only <strong>String</strong> 
values.</p>
<p>All classes inherit the <strong>toString</strong> method from the <strong>Object</strong> 
class. Many of the classes <em>override</em> this method 
to provide an implementation that is meaningful for objects of that class. </p>
<p>In addition, you may sometimes need to <em>override</em> the <strong>toString</strong> method 
for classes that you define to provide a meaningful <strong>toString</strong> behavior for 
objects of that class. </p>
<p>I explain the concept of overriding the <strong>toString</strong> method in detail in the chapter titled
<em>Java OOP: Polymorphism and the Object Class.</em></p>

<h1 ><a name="StringsandtheJavaCompiler"></a>
Strings and the Java compiler</h1>
<p>In Java, you specify literal strings between double quotes as in:</p>



<div class="a"><strong>Literal strings</strong>
				<pre>
&quot;I am a literal string of the String type.&quot;</pre>
</div>

<p>You can use literal strings anywhere you would use a <strong>String</strong> object. </p>
<p>You can also apply <strong>String</strong> methods directly to a literal string as in 
an <a href="#Listing_2">earlier program</a> that calls the <strong>length</strong> 
method on a literal string as shown below. </p>



<div class="a"><strong>Using String methods with literal strings</strong>
				<pre>
StringBuffer str6 = new StringBuffer(
	       "StringBuffer named str6&quot;.length());</pre>
</div>
	<p>Because the compiler automatically creates a new 
<strong>String</strong> object for every literal string, you can use a literal string to 
initialize a <strong>String</strong> object <em>(without use of the new operator)</em> as in 
the following code fragment from a <a href="#Listing_1">previous program</a>:
</p>



<div class="a">
				<pre>
String str1 = &quot;THIS STRING IS NAMED str1&quot;;</pre>
</div>
	<p>The above construct is equivalent to, but more efficient than the following, 
which, according to <em>The Java Tutorial</em> by Campione and Walrath, ends up 
creating two <strong>String</strong> objects instead of one: </p>



<div class="a">
				<pre>
String str1 = new String(&quot;THIS STRING IS NAMED str1&quot;);</pre>
</div>

<p>In this case, the compiler creates the first <strong>String</strong> object when it encounters the 
literal string, and the second one when it encounters <strong>new String()</strong>. </p>

<h1 ><a name="ConcatenationandtheOperator"></a>
Concatenation and the + operator</h1>
<p>The plus (+) operator is overloaded so that in addition to performing the normal arithmetic 
operations, it can also be used to concatenate strings.</p>
<p>This will come as no surprise to you because we have been using code such as 
the following since the beginning of this Ebook.</p>



<div class="a">
	<pre>
String cat = &quot;cat&quot;; </pre>
	<pre>
System.out.println(&quot;con&quot; + cat + &quot;enation&quot;);</pre>
</div>

<p>According to Campione and Walrath, Java uses <strong>StringBuffer</strong> objects 
behind the scenes to implement concatenation. They indicate that the above code
