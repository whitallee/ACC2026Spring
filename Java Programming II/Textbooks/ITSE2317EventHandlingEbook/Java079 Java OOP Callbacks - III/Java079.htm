<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Hopefully, by this point, you are familiar with the <em>callback</em> material 
in the earlier chapters. Therefore, I will avoid, insofar as practical, 
repeating the introductory material from those chapters. </p>
<p>In a real program involving callbacks, many different objects may ask
one object to notify them when any interesting event in a 
family of interesting events happens, and to identify the specific event 
that actually happened along with the notification. </p>
<p>In addition, it is often desirable to encapsulate information in an object 
and to pass that object as a parameter when the callback method is invoked. This 
chapter will enhance the previous program by providing this capability. </p>
<p>Also, sometimes the interfaces used to implement callbacks declare many 
callback methods, and some classes are interested in only a few 
of those methods. It can become burdensome to have to provide large numbers of 
empty methods in all the classes that implement such an interface. For this 
reason, a mechanism known in Java terms as an <strong>adapter </strong>class is used to 
reduce the burden. </p>
<p>This chapter will show you how to create and use such <strong>adapter </strong>classes.
</p>
<p>We will continue with our earlier scenario consisting of a <em>teacher </em>and 
some <em>students</em>. At this point, we have expanded our scenario to include 
many students and some animals in the classroom. </p>
<p>The students <em>(and the animals)</em> register themselves on the teachers roll book 
to be notified when it is time for recess, or<em> </em>it is time for lunch. </p>
<p>In this chapter, as in the earlier chapter, all of the students and all of the 
animals receive notification of both types of events (<em>recess </em>or <em>lunch</em>) 
but some of those who are notified choose to ignore the notification. However, 
in this chapter, the methodology for ignoring the notification is different than 
it was in the previous chapter. </p>

	<h1><a name="Sample_program">Sample program</a></h1>
	
	<p>In case you just started reading at this point, this program named
	<strong>Callback04</strong> is an enhanced version of the earlier program 
	named <strong>Callback03</strong>. You should familiarize yourself with the 
	earlier program before trying to understand this program. </p>
<p>This version of the program makes two unrelated enhancements to the program 
named <strong>Callback03</strong>. </p>
<ul>
	<li>First, a new class is defined in conjunction with the <strong>CallBack
	</strong>interface that makes it possible for the <strong>Teacher </strong>
	class to encapsulate information into an object and pass that object as a 
	parameter whenever a callback is made. </li>
	<li>Second, a new class is defined in conjunction with the <strong>CallBack
	</strong>interface which, in Java terminology, is often called an <strong>
	adapter </strong>class. </li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>adapter</strong> class, as defined here, is a convenience class 
that implements the interface and defines all the methods declared in the 
interface with empty methods. Then any class that needs to implement the 
interface can <em><strong>extend</strong> </em>the adapter class without a 
requirement to define those methods that are not of interest. </p>
<p>In this version of the program, the <strong>CallBack</strong> interface is 
expanded to declare several dummy methods to emphasize this benefit of the use 
of an <strong>adapter </strong>class. </p>
<p>Note that objects of a class that <em>extends </em>the adapter class can be 
referred to by the interface type. Thus, interface type is an inherited 
attribute that results from <em>extending </em>a class that <em>implements </em>
an interface. </p>
<p>Using an <strong>adapter </strong>class also makes it possible to expand the 
interface later, by declaring new methods, without breaking code that already
<strong>implements </strong>the interface, provided that the <strong>adapter</strong> 
class is appropriately redefined. In this sense, the <strong>adapter</strong> 
class is a little more than a convenience class. </p>
<p>This version of the program defines three different classes named <strong>
Student</strong>, <strong>Dog</strong>, and <strong>Cat</strong>, that <em>
implement </em>the <strong>CallBack </strong>interface <em>indirectly </em>by 
extending the adapter class. </p>
<p>Mixed objects of these three types are maintained in a common list by an 
object of the <strong>Teacher</strong> class and 
notified at callback time. </p>
<p>As in the previous version of the program, the <strong>Dog </strong>class 
ignores the<strong> recess </strong>callback and the <strong>Cat </strong>
class ignores the <strong>lunch</strong> callback. In this program, classes simply don't bother to override methods of the interface that are not of 
interest. </p>
<p>The <strong>Student </strong>class responds to both types of callbacks with 
fully- defined methods. </p>
<p>The program defines a <strong>Teacher </strong>class that has the ability to 
create and maintain a list of objects of the interface type, and to notify those 
objects that something interesting has happened by invoking either the <strong>
recess</strong> method or the <strong>lunch</strong> method on all the objects 
on the list. An object is instantiated and passed as a parameter whenever one or 
the other of these methods is invoked. </p>
<p>Finally, the program defines a controlling class that ties all the pieces 
together and exercises them. </p>
<p>The program was originally tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95. More recently 
it was tested using Java 12.0.1 and Windows 7.</p>

<h2><a name="Interesting_code_fragments">Interesting code fragments</a></h2>

<h3><a name="The_interface_named_CallBack">The interface named CallBack</a></h3>
<p>We begin by defining an interface named <strong>CallBack</strong> that will create a new type and will 
declare two generic methods named <strong>recess</strong> and <strong>lunch</strong> that can be used to callback any object that is of a 
class that implements the interface. The interface named <strong>CallBack</strong> 
is shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a>.</p>

<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. The interface named CallBack.</p>
<pre>
interface CallBack{
  public void recess(CallBackObjectClass obj);
  public void lunch(CallBackObjectClass obj);
  
  public void dummy1(CallBackObjectClass obj);
  public void dummy2(CallBackObjectClass obj);
  public void dummy3(CallBackObjectClass obj);
  public void dummy4(CallBackObjectClass obj);
  public void dummy5(CallBackObjectClass obj);
  public void dummy6(CallBackObjectClass obj);

}//end interface CallBack
</pre>
</div>
<p>In addition to two methods mentioned above, the interface also declares
several additional dummy methods to emphasize the benefit of 
extending the adapter class that is defined later. </p>
<p>Note also that the methods now require a parameter, which was not the case in 
earlier chapters. The 
class for this parameter will be defined soon next.</p>
<h3><a name="The_class_named_CallBackObjectClass">The class named 
CallBackObjectClass</a></h3>


<p><a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> defines a class from which we can instantiate 
an object to pass as a parameter in the callback methods. This class can be as 
simple or as elaborate as needed to convey the amount and type of information 
needed with the callback. In our case, it contains a single <strong>String</strong> 
object. </p>





<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. The class named CallBackObjectClass. </p>
<pre>
class CallBackObjectClass{
  String data;
  
  CallBackObjectClass(String data){//constructor
    this.data = data;
  }//end constructor
}//end CallBackObjectClass
</pre>
</div>
<h3><a name="The_class_named_CallBackAdapter">The class named CallBackAdapter</a></h3>
<p>Listing 3 shows the definition of the adapter class for the <strong>CallBack </strong>interface. This class defines all the interface methods with empty 
methods. </p>




<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a>. The class named CallBackAdapter. </p>
<pre>
class CallBackAdapter implements CallBack{
  public void recess(CallBackObjectClass obj){};
  public void lunch(CallBackObjectClass obj){};
  
  public void dummy1(CallBackObjectClass obj){};
  public void dummy2(CallBackObjectClass obj){};
  public void dummy3(CallBackObjectClass obj){};
  public void dummy4(CallBackObjectClass obj){};
  public void dummy5(CallBackObjectClass obj){};
  public void dummy6(CallBackObjectClass obj){};  
}//end class CallBackAdapter
</pre>
</div>
<p>Classes that need to <em>implement</em> the <strong>CallBack</strong> interface can now </p>
<ul>
	<li><em>extend </em>the <strong>CallBackAdapter</strong> class,</li>
	<li><em>override </em>only the empty methods of interest, and 
</li>
	<li>ignore the other methods. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that the existence of the <strong>
adapter</strong> does not prevent another class from <em>implementing</em> the 
interface directly instead of <em>extending</em> the <strong>adapter</strong> class. </p>
<p>Objects of a class that <em>extends </em>the <strong>CallBackAdapter</strong> class can be referenced as the 
interface type <strong>CallBack</strong>.</p>
<h3><a name="The_class_named_Teacher">The class named Teacher</a></h3>

<p>Next we need a class whose objects can maintain a list of registered objects 
of type <strong>CallBack </strong>and can notify all the objects on that list 
when something interesting happens. This class has the ability to invoke two 
different callback methods: <strong>recess</strong> and <strong>lunch</strong>.
</p>
<p>Obviously, if you have been following this development, you will know by now 
that this is the class named <strong>Teacher</strong>. </p>
<p>The only thing significantly different about this version of the <strong>
Teacher</strong> class is the fact that it instantiates and passes an object of 
type <strong>CallBackObjectClass</strong> whenever it makes a callback. </p>
<p>Since you have seen this method several times before, and should be very 
familiar with it by now, I am going to delete most of the code in the class and 
show you only that portion of the code that invokes the <strong>recess</strong> 
callback method on all the objects on the list, instantiating and passing an 
object of type <strong>CallBackObjectClass</strong> as a parameter in each case.
The abbreviated version of the <strong>Teacher</strong> class is shown in 
<a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a>.</p>


<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. Abbreviated version of the Teacher class.
</p>
<pre>
class Teacher{
  //code deleted

  void callRecess(){
    //code deleted

    for(int cnt = 0; cnt &lt; tempList.size(); cnt++){
      ((CallBack)tempList.elementAt(cnt)).recess(
                      new CallBackObjectClass(" Recess"));
    }//end for loop
  }//end callRecess()
  //code deleted

}//end class Teacher
</pre>
</div>
<h3><a name="The_class_named_Dog">The class named Dog</a></h3>
<p>That brings us to the three classes that implement the <strong>CallBack </strong>interface <em>indirectly </em>by <em>extending </em>the <strong>
CallBackAdapter </strong>class. </p>
<p>Objects of these three classes can be registered on the list maintained by an 
object of the <strong>Teacher </strong>class, and will be notified whenever that 
object invokes either the <strong>recess</strong> method or the <strong>lunch</strong> method on the registered objects on the list. </p>
<p>Part of the notification will be an object passed as a parameter to the 
callback method. Code in the callback method can either ignore that object, or 
can extract the information from the object and use it. </p>
<p>These three classes are very similar, so I will show you only one of them 
here. To be consistent with the previous chapter, I will show you the definition 
for the <strong>Dog</strong> class that ignores the <strong>recess</strong> 
callback. This class, which is shown in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a>, also ignores all of the <em>
dummy </em>methods that were 
declared in the <strong>CallBack</strong> interface in this program. </p>




<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. The class named Dog.
</p>
<pre>
class Dog extends CallBackAdapter{
  String name; //store name here for later ID
  //-----------------------------------------------------//
  
  Dog(String name){//constructor
    this.name = name; //save the name to identify the obj
  }//end constructor
  //-----------------------------------------------------//

  //An object of the Teacher class can invoke this 
  // method as a callback mechanism passing an object
  // as a parameter.
  public void lunch(CallBackObjectClass obj){//announce
    System.out.println(name + obj.data);
  }//end overridden lunch()
  //-----------------------------------------------------//
}//end class Dog
</pre>
</div>
<p>Note first that this class <em>extends</em> the <strong>CallBackAdapter</strong> 
class and does not <em>implement </em>any interfaces. </p>
<p>Note also that it only overrides the <strong>lunch</strong> method from the
<strong>adapter</strong> class, ignoring all of the other empty methods defined 
in that class. Were it not for the <strong>adapter</strong> class in this case, 
this <strong>Dog</strong> class definition would have to define the six dummy 
methods and the <strong>recess</strong> method with empty methods. Therefore, 
the availability of an adapter class can be a real convenience for the 
programmer. </p>
<p>Finally, note that code in the <strong>lunch</strong> method extracts the 
instance variable named <strong>data</strong> and displays that information 
instead of a literal string as was the case in the earlier versions of this 
program. </p>
<h3><a name="The_controlling_class_named_Callback04">The controlling class named 
Callback04</a></h3>
<p>That brings us to the controlling class that ties all the other pieces 
together and exercises them. The controlling class in this version of the 
program is no different from that of the earlier version named <strong>
Callback03</strong>. </p>
<p>Also, the output from running this version of the program is almost the same 
as the earlier version, with the main difference being that the callback methods 
display information encapsulated in an object passed to the method which was not 
the case in the earlier versions. The output can be seen in the complete program 
listing shown in <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a>. </p>
<p>Therefore, there should be no need to provide any further discussion 
regarding the testing of this version of the program.</p>

<h1><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p>We have objects of different classes registered on a common callback list 
where every object on the list receives a callback for every different type of 
callback event associated with the list. </p>
<p>Whenever a callback occurs, an object is instantiated to contain information 
and passed as a parameter to the callback method. The code in the callback 
method can either ignore that object, or extract the information from the object 
and use it. In this program, the code in the callback methods extracts and 
displays the information encapsulated in the object. </p>
<p>The different types of callbacks are established by the method declarations 
in the <strong>CallBack </strong>interface. </p>
<p>An <strong>adapter </strong>class is defined that implements the <strong>
CallBack </strong>interface and defines all of its methods as empty methods. </p>
<p>Each class of object that registers for callbacks can either respond to all 
of the different types of callbacks by overriding all of the callback methods in 
the <strong>adapter</strong> class, or can selectively ignore some types of 
callbacks simply by not overriding those methods. </p>
<p>Such a class can also ignore the <strong>adapter</strong> class and <em>
implement</em> the interface directly as in the earlier chapters. </p>

/*File Callback04.java Copyright, R.G.Baldwin
The purpose of this program is to develop a callback
capability using Interfaces.  

This is an enhanced version of the program named 
Callback03.  You should familiarize yourself with
the earlier program before getting into this program.

This version of the program makes two unrelated 
enhancements to the program named Callback03.

First, a new class is defined in conjunction with the
CallBack interface that makes it possible for the
Teacher class to encapsulate information into an object
and pass that object whenever a callback is made.

Second, a new class is defined in conjunction with the
CallBack interface which, in Java terminology, is often
called an adapter class.  This is a convenience class
that implements the interface and defines all the 
methods declared in the interface with empty methods.
Then any class that needs to implement the interface 
can extend the adapter class without a requirement to 
define those methods that are not of interest.

In this case, the interface is expanded to declare 
several dummy methods to emphasize this benefit of
the use of an adapter class.

Note that objects of classes that extend the adapter
class that implements the interface can be referred to 
by the interface type. Thus, interface type is an
inherited attribute that results from extending a class.

Using an adapter class also makes it possible to expand
the interface later by declaring new methods without 
breaking code that already implements the interface.

This version defines three different classes named 
Student, Dog, and Cat, that implement the CallBack 
interface indirectly by extending the adapter class.
These classes simply don't bother to define
methods of the interface that are not of interest.

Mixed objects of these three types are maintained 
on a list and notified at CallBack time.

The Dog class ignores the recess() callback and the 
Cat class ignores the lunch() callback.  The Student
class responds to both types of callbacks with fully-
defined methods.

The program defines a Teacher class that has the 
ability to create and maintain a list of objects
of the interface type, and to notify those objects
that something interesting has happened by invoking
either the recess() method or the lunch() method on all 
the objects on the list.

Finally, the program defines a controlling class that
ties all the pieces together and exercises them.

Tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95.
