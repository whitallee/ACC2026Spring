<h1><a name="preface"></a>Preface</h1>
<p>This chapter is one in a collection of chapters designed for teaching <em>
ITSE2317 - Java Programming (Intermediate)</em> at Austin Community College in 
Austin, TX.</p>
<p><em>(Author's note: As you read this chapter, you will see that it was 
originally written around 1997. However, despite many improvements in Java since 
then, most of what was true then is still true in 2020.)</em></p>
<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>When we discussed mouse events in an earlier chapter, we didn't take into 
account that there are actually two different mouse interfaces: </p>

<ul>
<li>MouseListener </li>
<li>MouseMotionListener</li></ul>

<p>In that chapter, we only discussed the implementation of methods in the <strong>
MouseListener </strong>interface. </p>
<p>In this chapter, we will also implement the <strong>mouseDragged()</strong> and the <strong>
mouseMoved()</strong> methods in the <strong>MouseMotionListener </strong>interface to 
implement a program that can move a <strong>Label </strong>object on a <strong>Panel </strong>
object by dragging the <strong>Label </strong>object with the mouse. </p>
<p>This chapter is not intended to be a polished demonstration of drag-and-drop. 
Rather, it is intended only to illustrate how to instantiate, register, listen 
for, and use events declared in the methods of the <strong>MouseMotionListener </strong>
interface. </p>
<p>This chapter will also make use of the <strong>mousePressed()</strong> method of the <strong>
MouseListener </strong>interface. </p>
<h1><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h1><p>The <strong>MouseMotionListener </strong>interface declares two methods: <br/>
 </p>
<div class="a">
<ul>
<li>public abstract void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) </li>
<li>public abstract void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e)</li></ul>
</div>
<p>The <strong>mouseDragged() </strong>method is invoked when a mouse button is pressed 
on a component and then dragged. </p>
<p>According to the documentation, mouse drag events will continue to be 
delivered to the component where they first originated until the mouse 
button is released (regardless of whether the mouse position is within 
the bounds of the component). </p>
<p>However, by disabling the code in the following sample program that moves the 
Label object, and observing the printed output on the screen, it can be seen 
that mouse drag events cease to be generated as soon as the mouse leaves 
the boundaries of the object for which the listener was registered. Furthermore, 
moving the mouse back inside the boundaries of the object does not cause 
mouse drag events to resume until the mouse button is released and pressed 
again. </p>
<p>It is unclear at this time whether this is a bug, a documentation error, or 
simply a misinterpretation of the documentation on the part of this author. </p>
<p>The <strong>mouseMoved() </strong>method is invoked when the mouse is moved on a 
component (with no buttons down). A <strong>System.out.println()</strong> statement in the <strong>
mouseMoved()</strong> method in the following program indicates that a stream of 
events is generated when the mouse is moved inside the label and the events stop 
being generated when the mouse leaves the label. The stream of events resumes 
when the mouse re-enters the label. </p>
<h1><a name="the_sample_program"></a>The 
Sample Program</h1><p>This section will present a short discussion of the program followed 
by the program listing. </p>
<h2><a name="discussion"></a>Discussion</h2><p>The program illustrates the <strong>mouseDragged() </strong>
event used in conjunction with <strong>mousePressed()</strong>. </p>
<p>The program uses a combination of <strong>mousePressed() </strong>and <strong>mouseDragged()</strong> 
events to implement a crude form of <i>Drag-and-Drop</i>. </p>
<p>A yellow Label is placed on a <strong>Panel, </strong>which is placed in a <strong>Frame</strong>. </p>
<p>A <strong>MouseListener </strong>object and a <strong>MouseMotionListener </strong>object are 
instantiated and registered to receive mouse events on the <strong>Label </strong>
object. </p>
<p>The user can drag the <strong>Label </strong>object by dragging the mouse internal 
to the <strong>Label </strong>object. The algorithm that uses the information 
provided by a <strong>mousePressed()</strong> event and the <strong>mouseDragged() </strong>events 
to drag the <strong>Label</strong> object on the screen is explained in the comments in 
the program. </p>
<p>The purpose of this program is simply to demonstrate the use of the <strong>
MouseMotionListener </strong>interface as compared to the <strong>MouseListener </strong>
interface. It is not intended to be a polished <i>Drag-and-Drop</i> 
program. </p>
<p>The program also produces screen output showing the stream of events 
produced by the <strong>mouseDragged()</strong> and <strong>mouseMoved()</strong> methods. By 
viewing this output while moving or dragging the mouse, you can get an idea of 
how the event-handling system is behaving. </p>
<p>Finally, a <strong>WindowListener </strong>object is instantiated and registered to 
terminate the program when the user closes the Frame object. </p>
<p>These results were produced using JDK 1.1.3 running under Windows 95. More 
recently, the program was tested using JDK 12.0.1 running under Windows 7.</p>

This program is designed to be compiled and run
under JDK 1.1.3

The program illustrates the mouseDragged event used in
conjunction with the mousePressed() event to drag a label
object on a Panel object within a Frame object in a
crude form of Drag-and-Drop.

The program also illustrates the mouseMoved event by
displaying the contents of the object passed as a parameter
to the event when the mouse is moved within the label
without pressing a mouse button.

A yellow Label is placed on a Panel which is placed in a
Frame.

A MouseListener object and a MouseMotionListener object are
instantiated and registered to receive mouse events on the
Label object.

The user can drag the yellow Label object by dragging the
mouse internal to the Label object.

Comments within the code explain the algorithm that uses
the information provided by the mousePressed and mouseDragged
events to move the label object.

The purpose of this program is simply to demonstrate the
use of the MouseMotionListener interface as compared to the
MouseListener interface. It is not intended to be a
polished Drag-and-Drop program.

Finally, a WindowListener object is instantiated and
registered to terminate the program when the user closes
the Frame object.

These results were produced using JDK 1.1.3 running under
Windows 95.

 /* How does this work?
 Dragging the mouse on the yellow label produces a
 stream of events of this type. This method is called
 once for each event. When an event occurs, if the
 mouse has been dragged a distance equal to a full
 pixel (or more), in either or both directions,
 the X and Y values of the mouseDragged event
 are used to reposition the label by that distance in
 one or both of those directions. This causes the
 label to slide under the mouse pointer so that the
 X and Y values of the next mouseDragged event revert
 back to the original Y and Y values of the original
 mousePressed event. In other words, the motion of the
 label is such as to cause the coordinates of the
 mouseDragged event to continue to be equal to the
 coordinates of the original mousePressed event, or to
 cause the difference between the two to be zero.

 Think of the following expressions as a feedback system
 that strives to drive an error signal to zero where
 the error signal is the difference between the
 coordinates of the current mouseDragged event and the
 coordinates of the original mousePressed event.

 Note that when the yellow label is dragged rapidly
 and randomly for an extended period of time, the system
 simply quits generating mouseDragged events. This may
 be a bug in JDK 1.1.3 for Win95.

<h1><a name="Whats_Next">What's Next?</a></h1>
<p>This chapter as well as several previous chapters have used the AWT, Swing, 
the Delegation Event Model, and GUIs to help you learn how to use event handling 
in Java. However, the purpose of these chapters has been to teach event handling 
and not to teach GUI design. Therefore, no attempt has been made to teach GUI 
design.</p>
<p>The chapter following this one in this eBook begins a series of bonus 
chapters containing considerably more information on the use of the Swing GUI 
components. The material in those chapters is not part of this course, but 
instead is provided for the benefit of those students who have a desire to 
continue in that direction. </p>
<h1><a name="review"></a>Review</h1><p>Q - Without viewing the following solution, write a Java application 
that meets the specifications given in the comments at the beginning of the 
application. </p>
<p>A - See specifications and solution below.<br/>

<div class="a"><pre>/*File SampProg126.java from chapter 92
Copyright, R. G. Baldwin
Without viewing the following solution, write a Java
application that meets the specifications given below.

The solution shown below was successfully tested using
JDK 1.1.3 under Win95 and JDK 12.0.1 under Win 7.

Write an application that displays a Frame object with
a width of 300 pixels and a height of 200 pixels. Put
your name in the banner at the top of the Frame.

When you move your mouse pointer into the client area of
the Frame, the coordinates of the mouse pointer appear
directly above the pointer. As you move the mouse pointer
around in the client area, the coordinates of the pointer
continue to be displayed above the pointer.

When you move the mouse pointer out of the client area, the
coordinates of the exit point appear and remain in view
until you again move the pointer into the client area.

If you press one of the mouse buttons while moving the
mouse in the client area, the coordinates of the point
where you pressed the button appear and remain there until
you release the mouse button, at which time the
coordinates of the mouse pointer resume being displayed.

Closing the frame terminates the program and returns
control to the operating system.

End of specifications.
