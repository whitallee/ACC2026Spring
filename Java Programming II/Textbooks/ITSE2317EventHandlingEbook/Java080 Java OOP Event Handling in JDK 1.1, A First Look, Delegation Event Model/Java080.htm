	<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This chapter provides a description of the Delegation Event Model as 
defined in JDK 1.1 along with sample 
programs that illustrate some aspects of the model. I describe how the event model 
maps to the AWT API. </p>
<p>Much of this information was taken from the documentation 
released with the various versions of JDK 1.1, and is the intellectual property 
of Sun Microsystems. The material is being reproduced here for the sole purpose of assisting 
students in learning how to use the event model.</p>
<h1 class="style2"><a name="designGoals">Design Goals</a></h1>
<p>According to Sun, the primary design goals of the JDK 1.1 event model in the AWT are 
the following: </p>



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Design goals:</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Simple and easy to learn</li>
					<li>Support a clean separation between application and GUI 
					code</li>
					<li>Facilitate the creation of robust event handling code 
					which is less error-prone (strong compile-time checking)</li>
					<li>Flexible enough to enable varied application models for 
					event flow and propagation</li>
					<li>For visual tool builders, enable run-time discovery of 
					both events that a component generates as well as the events 
					it may observe</li>
					<li>Support backward binary compatibility with the old model</li>
				</ul>
</div>
	<p>It will be up to you to decide if they have met their goals. </p>
	
	<h1><a name="Simplified_Overview_of_the_New_Delegation_Model">Simplified Overview of the New Delegation Model</a></h1>
<p>First, I will provide a simplified overview of the model including a sample 
program. Following that, I will embark on a detailed discussion of the model. 
Hopefully the simplified discussion and the sample program will help you to 
understand the material in the detailed discussion. </p>
<p>Also, the earlier chapter on 
callbacks should have given you considerable 
background to help you understand this material. If you are not familiar with 
the callback material, you should go back and review that material. </p>
<p><strong>Event sources and listeners</strong></p>
<p>Events are now organized into a hierarchy of event classes. The model makes use of <b>event sources</b> and <b>event listeners</b>.
</p>
<p>An event <strong>source</strong> is an object that has the ability</p>
<ul>
	<li>to determine when an 
interesting event has occurred, and </li>
	<li>to notify listener objects of the 
occurrence of the event. </li>
</ul>
<p>Although you as the programmer establish the framework 
for such notification, the actual notification takes place automatically behind 
the scenes. </p>
<p>A <strong>listener</strong> object is an instance of a class <em>(or instance of a subclass of a 
class)</em> that </p>
<ul>
	<li>implements a specific listener interface. </li>
</ul>
<p>A number of 
listener interfaces are defined where each interface declares the methods 
appropriate for a specific class of events. Thus, there is natural pairing of 
classes of events and interface definitions. </p>
<p>For example, there is a class of mouse events that includes most of the 
events normally associated with mouse action. There is a matching interface 
definition, which is used to define a listener class for those events <em>(actually 
this is the one case where two interfaces are defined to match up with a single 
event class)</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
<p>A listener object can be <em>registered</em> on a source object to be notified of the 
occurrence of all events of the specific class for which the listener object is 
designed. </p>
<p>Once a listener object is registered to be notified of those events, the 
occurrence of an event defined by the specified class will automatically call 
the matching method in the listener object. The code in the body of the method 
is designed by the programmer to perform the desired action when the event 
occurs. </p>
<p><strong>Multiple notification methods</strong></p>
<p>Some event classes <em>(such as the mouse events, for example)</em> involve a number 
of different possible event types <em>(notification methods)</em>. A listener class 
that implements the 
matching interface for that event class must implement or define <em>(provide a body 
for)</em> all the methods declared in the interface. </p>
<p><strong>Adapter classes</strong></p>
<p>An intermediate set of classes, known as <i>Adapter </i>classes, is 
provided to prevent this from becoming burdensome. These Adapter classes implement the listener interfaces, and define the 
matching interface methods with empty methods. </p>
<p>A listener class can then be defined that <i>extends </i>the Adapter class instead of <i>implementing </i>
the corresponding listener interface. With this approach, the listener class need only override those 
methods of interest since the requirement to define all of the interface 
methods has already been satisfied by the Adapter class. </p>
<p><strong>An example</strong></p>
<p>For example, in the sample program that follows, two different listener 
objects instantiated from two different listener classes are registered to 
receive all events involving the manipulation of a <strong>Frame</strong> object 
<em>(opening, 
closing, minimizing, etc.)</em>. </p>
<blockquote><em>(Author's note: You will learn about the use of more modern 
JFrame objects in a future chapter titled Java081 Swing and the Delegation Event Model.)</em></blockquote>
<p>One of the listener classes <i>implements </i>the <b>WindowListener </b>
interface and hence must define all six methods of that interface. </p>
<p>The other listener class <i>extends </i>the <b>WindowAdapter </b>class, which 
in turn <i>implements </i>the <b>WindowListener </b>interface. The <b>
WindowAdapter </b>class defines all six methods as empty methods. Thus, this 
listener class can get by with overriding only two of the six methods of 
the interface.</p>
	<h2 class="style2"><a name="Sample_Program">Sample Program</a></h2>
<p>This program named <a href="#Listing_9">Event08</a> was designed for simplicity. In this program, the code in each 
of the methods is simple. In all cases but one, the code simply displays a 
message indicating that the method has been called. Obviously, in order for a 
program to be of much value, the body of code in the methods would have to be 
much more substantive, or at least would have to call other methods that are 
more substantive. </p>
<p>This program illustrates the use of <i>Event Sources</i>,<i> Event Listeners</i>, 
and <i>Adapters </i>in the <i>Delegation Event Model</i>. </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Briefly, <a href="#Listing_9">this program</a> instantiates an object that creates a user interface 
consisting of a simple <b>Frame </b>object. This object is an <i>Event 
Source</i> that notifies two different <i>Event Listener</i> objects of <b>
Window </b>events. </p>
<p>One of the <b>Listener </b>objects <i>implements </i>the <b>WindowListener
</b>interface and defines all of the methods declared in that interface. The 
other <b>Listener </b>object <i>extends </i>the <b>Adapter </b>class named <b>
WindowAdapter</b>. </p>
<p>As explained earlier, the purpose of <b>Adapter </b>classes <em>(as used in 
this context)</em> is to implement the <b>Listener </b>interfaces and to define all of the 
methods with empty methods.</p>
<p>Classes that <i>extend </i>the <b>Adapter </b>classes can then selectively 
override only those methods of interest. This <strong>Listener</strong> object 
overrides only two of the methods.</p>
<p>This program was originally tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95. More recently 
it was tested using JDK 12.0.1 under Windows 7.</p>
<p>The output produced by running the program is presented later in this chapter.</p>
<h2><a name="Interesting_Code_Fragments">Interesting Code Fragments</a></h2>
<p><a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> shows the <b>main</b> method of the 
controlling class that instantiates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) object. 
There are more compact <em>(and more cryptic)</em> ways to accomplish this 
objective, but for the time being, in order to achieve clarity, I will use this 
approach. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a> - The main method for 
				Event08.

				</p>

				<pre>public class Event08 {//controlling class
  public static void main(String[] args){
    GUI gui = new GUI();//instantiate a GUInterface object
  }//end main
}//end class Event08</pre>
</div>
	<p>The <b>GUI </b>class is rather long, so I will break it up and discuss it in 
parts.</p>
<p>This class is used</p>
<ul>
	<li>to instantiate and display a user interface object,</li>
	<li>to instantiate two <strong>Listener</strong> objects, and</li>
	<li>to register those two objects for notification whenever a <strong>Window</strong> event 
	occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The class begins by defining its own constructor. The first interesting code 
in the constructor is the code to instantiate an object of type <b>Frame</b>, 
set its size, and give it a title, as shown in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>.</p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a> - Beginning of the 
				constructor.

				</p>

				<pre>class GUI{
  public GUI(){//constructor
    //Create a new Frame object
    Frame displayWindow = new Frame();
    displayWindow.setSize(300,200);
    displayWindow.setTitle("Copyright, R.G.Baldwin");</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>What is a Frame?</strong></p>
<p>The JDK documentation describes a <strong>Frame</strong> as follows:</p>



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Description of a Frame:</strong> 
				
				</p>
				
				<p>A <b>Frame </b>is a 
				top-level window with a title and a border. The default layout 
				for a frame is <b>BorderLayout</b>.<em> (You will learn more about 
				layout managers later.) </em></p>
				<p>Frames are capable of generating the following types of 
				window events:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WindowOpened</li>
					<li>WindowClosing</li>
					<li>WindowClosed</li>
					<li>WindowIconified</li>
					<li>WindowDeiconified</li>
					<li>WindowActivated</li>
					<li>WindowDeactivated.</li>
				</ul>

</div>
	<p>Stated differently, a <b>Frame</b> object is the type of <b>GUI </b>object 
that we might refer to as a window or a form in a typical <b>GUI </b>
environment.</p>
<p><strong>Instantiate two Listener objects</strong></p>
<p><a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> instantiates two <b>Listener </b>objects that will process <b>
Window </b>events. </p>
<p>The class definitions, named <b>Wproc1 </b>and <b>Wproc2</b>, for these two 
classes will follow the discussion of the <b>GUI </b>class. </p>
<p><em>(Note that I am passing a reference to the </em> <b><em>Frame </em> </b>
<em>object to the 
constructor for one of these classes. There is a better (and more cryptic) way 
to achieve the same objective without the need to pass the reference. Again, 
since this program was designed for clarity, I am doing it the obvious way.)</em></p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_3">Listing 3</a> - Instantiate two Listener objects.

				</p>

				<pre>
    WProc1 winProcCmd1 = new WProc1(displayWindow);
    WProc2 winProcCmd2 = new WProc2();</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>Register the listener objects</strong></p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> is extremely important. This is the code by which we 
register the listener objects for notification of <b>Window </b>events where the
<b>Frame</b> object named <b>displayWindow</b> is the source of the events.</p>
<p>Pay close attention to the syntax of these two statements, because you will 
be using this syntax often. In subsequent chapters, we will dig deeper into the
<i>Delegation Event Model</i> and I will teach you what is going on behind the scenes 
when you execute statements of this sort. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_4">Listing 4</a> - Register the listener objects. </p>

				<pre>    displayWindow.addWindowListener(winProcCmd1);
    displayWindow.addWindowListener(winProcCmd2);</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>The interpretation of the code in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> is that the two listener objects 
named <b>winProcCmd1 </b>and <b>winProcCmd2 </b>are added to a list of listener 
objects that are to be automatically notified </p>
<ul>
	<li>whenever an event of the <b>WindowEvent </b>class occurs </li>
	<li>with respect to the <b>Frame </b>object named <b>displayWindow</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These listener objects are notified by calling the methods in the objects 
that match the specific type of the event <em>(open window, close window, closing 
window, minimize window, etc.)</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Make the Frame visible</strong></p>
<p>We wrap up the definition of our <b>GUI </b>class with the statement shown in
<a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> that 
causes the <b>Frame </b>object to become visible on the screen. Note that this 
statement also causes the <b>windowActivated </b>and <b>windowOpened </b>events 
to be generated. <em>(Current jargon would say that those events are &quot;fired&quot;.)</em></p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_5">Listing 5</a> - Make the Frame visible.
				</p>
				<pre>    displayWindow.setVisible(true);
  }//end constructor
}//end GUI class definition</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>Code for the Listener objects</strong></p>
<p>At this point, we have examined the code that will create a <b>Frame </b>
object and display it on the screen. We have also examined the code that <i>
registers </i>two <b>Listener </b>objects on the <b>Frame </b>object. However, 
at this point, the program cannot be compiled because the classes from which the 
two <b>Listener </b>objects are to be instantiated have not yet been defined. 
That will be our next assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning of the class named WProc1</strong></p>
<p><a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> begins the definition of the classes that can be used to 
instantiate <b>Listener </b>objects. </p>
<p>The first class definition that we will look at <i>implements </i>the <b>
WindowListener </b>interface. This requires that all the methods declared in the 
interface be defined in this class. This class defines all of the methods. Each 
of the methods displays a descriptive message whenever it is called. </p>
<p>I will begin the discussion with the constructor as shown in
<a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a>.
</p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_6">Listing 6</a> - Beginning of the class named WProc1.
				</p>
				<pre>class WProc1 implements WindowListener{
  Frame displayWindowRef;

  WProc1(Frame windowIn){//constructor
    this.displayWindowRef = windowIn;
  }//end constructor</pre>
</div>
	<p><em>(Note that the constructor for this class requires a reference to the
	</em> <b><em>Source </em> </b><em>object to be passed as 
a parameter. As mentioned earlier, this is not the preferred way to accomplish 
our objective, but it is the most straightforward and easy to understand. That 
is why I elected to use it here. The code in the constructor saves a reference 
to the </em> <b><em>Source</em></b><em> object in an instance variable named 
	</em> <b><em>displayWindowRef</em></b><em>.)</em></p>
	<p><strong>Implementing the WindowListener interface</strong></p>
<p>It is important to note that this class <i>implements </i>the <b>
WindowListener </b>interface. This means that it must define all of the methods 
that are declared in that interface.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">If you examine the complete program listing (<a href="#Listing_9">Listing 
9</a>), you will 
see that there is one method definition in this class definition for each of the 
methods that are declared in the <b>WindowListener </b>interface. </p>
<p>The definition of all the interface methods are very similar, so I am not 
going to show all of them here. However, I will show the one that requires the reference to 
the source object that was discussed above, which is the most complicated one of 
the set. </p>
<p><strong>The windowClosing event handler</strong></p>
<p>The methods that are declared in the listener interfaces are often referred 
to as <em>event handler</em> methods or <em>event handlers</em> for short. The <b>windowClosing</b> event handler method is shown in
<a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a>. As 
you can see, this method starts out by displaying a message. Then it 
calls the <b>dispose</b> method on the <b>Frame </b>object. That is the 
reason that a reference to the <b>Frame </b>object was required to be passed in 
as a parameter. </p>
<p>Calling the <b>dispose</b> method causes a <b>WindowClosed</b> event to be 
fired. <em>(As far as I know, that is the only way to cause a WindowClosed event 
to be fired.)</em></p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_7">Listing 7</a> - The windowClosing event handler.</p>
<pre>  public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e){
    System.out.println("WProc1 windowClosing test msg");
    displayWindowRef.dispose();//generate WindowClosed
  }//end windowClosing()</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>The class named WProc2</strong></p>
<p>The class definition shown in <a href="#Listing_8">Listing 8</a> does not <i>implement </i>the <b>WindowListener </b>
interface. Instead, it <i>extends </i>the <b>WindowAdapter </b>class. 
Therefore, it can selectively override only those methods that are of interest.</p>
<p>In this case, only two of the methods of the <b>WindowListener </b>interface 
are overridden. These overridden methods display a message whenever they are 
called. </p>
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_8">Listing 8</a> - Definition for the class 
				named WProc2.
				</p>
				<pre>class WProc2 extends WindowAdapter{

  public void windowIconified(WindowEvent e){
    System.out.println(
              "******** WProc2 windowIconified test msg");
  }//end windowIconified()

  public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent e){
    System.out.println(
            "******** WProc2 windowDeiconified test msg");
  }//end windowDeiconified()

}//end class WProc2</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>Program output</strong></p>
<p><a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a> shows a sample output from this program. The small <strong>Frame</strong>

Briefly, this application instantiates an object that
creates a user interface consisting of a simple Frame
object.  This object is an Event Source that notifies two
different Event Listener objects of Window events.

One of the Listener objects implements the WindowListener
interface and overrides all of the methods declared in
that interface.

The other Listener object extends the Adapter class named
WindowAdapter.  The purpose of Adapter classes is to
implement the  Listener interfaces and to define all of
the methods with empty methods.  Classes that extend the
Adapter classes can then selectively override only those
methods of interest.  This Listener object overrides only
two of the methods.

Note that this application does not terminate and return
control to the operating system.  You must forcefully
terminate it.

This program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95.

When executed, this application places a simple empty
Frame object on the screen.

Starting the program produces the following output:
WProc1 windowActivated test msg
Wproc1 windowOpened test msg

Pressing the minimize button on the Frame produces the
following output:

WProc1 windowIconified test msg
******** WProc2 windowIconified test msg
WProc1 windowDeactivated test msg

Restoring the Frame after minimization produces the
following output:

WProc1 windowActivated test msg
WProc1 windowDeiconified test msg
******** WProc2 windowDeiconified test msg
WProc1 windowActivated test msg

Closing the Frame by pressing the X-icon in the upper
right of the Frame produces the following output.

WProc1 windowClosing test msg
WProc1 windowDeactivated test msg
WProc1 windowClosed test msg

	<h1><a name="More_Detailed_Overview_of_the_Delegation_Model">More Detailed 
	Overview of the Delegation Model</a></h1>
<p>JDK 1.1 encapsulates events in a class hierarchy with the root class named <b>
java.util.EventObject</b>. </p>
<p>The propagation of an event from a <b>Source </b>object to a <b>Listener </b>
object involves calling a method on the <b>Listener </b>object and passing an 
object that contains encapsulated information about the event. Note that each 
event class may include more than one actual type of event <em>(as determined by 
the methods declared in the listener interface)</em>. </p>
<p><strong>An event listener</strong></p>
<p>A <b>Listener </b>object is an instance of a class that <i>implements </i>a 
specific <b>EventListener </b>interface extended from the generic <b>
java.util.EventListener</b>. </p>
<p>An <b>EventListener </b>interface declares one or more methods that must be 
defined in the <b>Listener </b>class. Those methods are called by the event source in 
response to each specific event type handled by the interface. </p>
<p>The calling of these methods is the mechanism by which the <b>Source </b>
notifies the <b>Listener </b>of the occurrence of an event of a specific type.
</p>
<p><strong>An event source</strong></p>
<p>An <b>Event Source</b> is an object that &quot;originates&quot; or &quot;fires&quot; events by 
calling the methods of one or more <b>Listener </b>objects. The <b>Source </b>
maintains a list containing a reference to all of the <b>Listener </b>objects 
that have <i>registered</i> to be notified of events of that class. </p>
<p><strong>Registration of event listener objects</strong></p>
<p>The programmer causes <strong>Listener</strong> objects to be added to this 
list using <b>add<em>(EventType)</em>Listener</b> 
method calls. </p>
<p>Placing references to <b>Listener </b>objects on the list is often referred 
to as <i>registering</i> specific <b>Listeners </b>to receive notification of 
specific events. </p>
<p><strong>Notifying listener objects</strong></p>
<p>Once the list is populated <em>(</em><b><em>Listener </em></b><em>objects are 
registered)</em>, the <b>Source </b>object uses that list to notify each <b>
Listener </b>of the occurrence of an event of the specified type without further 
effort on the part of the programmer. </p>
<p><strong>Event sources and listeners</strong></p>
<p>The <b>Event Source </b>is often a <b>GUI </b>component and the <b>Listener
</b>is commonly an object of a class that implements the appropriate listener 
interface, but this is not a requirement. For example you will learn later how to 
cause a program to generate events without any physical involvement on the part 
of a user and a <b>GUI </b>component. </p>
<p>The <b>Listener </b>object could also be another AWT component that 
implements one or more <b>Listener </b>interfaces for the purpose of hooking <b>
GUI </b>objects up to each other.</p>
<h2><a name="Event_Hierarchy">Event Hierarchy</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, each specific event type is a member of a class of 
event types and these classes form a hierarchy of event classes. </p>
<p>Since a single event class may be used to represent more than one event type
<em>(i.e. </em><b><em>MouseEvent </em></b><em>represents mouse up, mouse down, 
mouse drag, mouse move, etc.)</em>, some event classes may also contain an &quot;id&quot;
<em>(unique within that class)</em> that maps to its specific event types. </p>
<p><strong>Setter and getter methods</strong></p>
<p>There are no public fields in the event classes. Rather the data in the event 
is encapsulated and available only through the use of appropriate <em>setter</em> 
and <em>getter</em> methods. </p>
<p>The <i>setter </i>methods only exist for attributes on an event that can be 
modified by a listener. If you continue with your studies in Java, you will 
learn that the <em>setter</em> and <em>getter</em> methods match a <i>design 
pattern</i> 
for <strong>Java Beans</strong>. </p>
<p>A concrete set of event classes is defined by the AWT. In addition, 
programmers may define their own event types by subclassing either <b>
java.util.EventObject</b> or one of the AWT event classes.</p>
<h2><a name="LowLevel_vs_Semantic_Events">Low-level vs. Semantic Events</a></h2>
<p>The AWT provides two conceptual types of events: </p>
<ul>
	<li>low-level events</li>
	<li>semantic events</li>
</ul>
	<p><strong>Low-level events</strong></p>
<p>A <i>low-level</i> event is one that represents a low-level input or 
	window-system occurrence on a visual component on the screen. As of February 
	1997, JDK 1.1 defined the following low-level event classes: </p>



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Low-level event classes</strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>java.util.EventObject<ul>
			<li>java.awt.AWTEvent<ul>
				<li>java.awt.event.ComponentEvent (component resized, moved,etc.)<ul>
					<li>java.awt.event.FocusEvent (component got focus, lost focus)</li>
					<li>java.awt.event.InputEvent<ul>
						<li>java.awt.event.KeyEvent (component got key-press, key-release,etc.)</li>
						<li>java.awt.event.MouseEvent (component got mouse-down, mouse-move,etc.)</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>java.awt.event.ContainerEvent</li>
					<li>java.awt.event.WindowEvent</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

</div>
	<p>As indicated earlier, some of the event classes encompass several different 
event types. Generally, there are corresponding <b>Listener </b>interfaces for 
each of the event classes, and corresponding interface methods for each of the 
different event types in each event class.</p>
<p><strong>Semantic events</strong></p>
<p><i>Semantic </i>events are defined at a higher-level to encapsulate the 
semantics of a user interface component&#39;s model. As of February 1997, the 
semantic event classes defined by the JDK 1.1 version of the AWT were as 
follows: </p>



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Semantic event classes</strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>java.util.EventObject<ul>
			<li>java.awt.AWTEvent<ul>
				<li>java.awt.event.ActionEvent (&quot;do a command&quot;)</li>
				<li>java.awt.event.AdjustmentEvent (&quot;value was adjusted&quot;)</li>
				<li>java.awt.event.ItemEvent (&quot;item state has changed&quot;)</li>
				<li>java.awt.event.TextEvent (&quot;the value of the text object changed&quot;)</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

</div>
	<p><strong>A more general event type</strong></p>
<p>The <i>semantic </i>events are not tied to specific screen-based component 
classes, but may apply across a set of components that implement a similar 
semantic model. For example, a <b>Button </b>object will fire an <i>&quot;action&quot;</i> 
event when it is pressed and a <b>List </b>object will fire an <i>&quot;action&quot;</i> 
event when an item is double-clicked.</p>
<p><strong>Not tied to user actions</strong></p>
<p>Even though the above discussion seems to tie these event classes to user 
actions on screen components <em>(because that is the norm)</em>, you need to remember 
that there is nothing to prevent you from having your code generate events of 
these types completely independent of such user actions. For example, you can 
easily cause an <b>ActionEvent </b>to be generated and attributed to some 
component whenever a software timer expires. We will learn how to do this sort 
of thing in subsequent chapters.</p>
<h2><a name="Event_Listeners">Event Listeners</a></h2>
	<p>An <b>EventListener </b>interface will typically have a separate method 
	for each distinct event type that the event class represents. For example, 
	the <b>FocusEventListener </b>interface defines two methods, <b>focusGained</b> 
	and <b>focusLost</b>, one for each event type that the <b>FocusEvent </b>
	class represents. </p>
<p><strong>Low-level listener interfaces</strong></p>
<p>As of February 1997, the low-level listener interfaces defined by the JDK 1.1 
version of the AWT were as follows: </p>



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Low-level listener interfaces</strong></p>
<ul>
		<li>java.util.EventListener<ul>
			<li>java.awt.event.ComponentListener</li>
			<li>java.awt.event.ContainerListener</li>
			<li>java.awt.event.FocusListener</li>
			<li>java.awt.event.KeyListener</li>
			<li>java.awt.event.MouseListener</li>
			<li>java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener</li>
			<li>java.awt.event.WindowListener</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

</div>
	<p>If you match this up with the previous list of <i>low-level </i>event 
classes, you will see that there is a listener interface defined for each of the 
&quot;leaf&quot; classes in the hierarchy of event classes. <em>(In fact, there are two 
different listener interfaces defined for the </em> <b><em>MouseEvent</em></b><em> class. This will 
be discussed further at the appropriate point in time.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Semantic listener interfaces</strong></p>
<p>As of February 1997, the semantic listener interfaces defined by the AWT were as follows: </p>



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Semantic event listener interfaces</strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>java.util.EventListener<ul>
			<li>java.awt.event.ActionListener</li>
			<li>java.awt.event.AdjustmentListener</li>
			<li>java.awt.event.ItemListener</li>
			<li>java.awt.event.TextListener</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

</div>
	<p>There is a one-to-one correspondence between <i>semantic </i>listener 
interfaces and <i>semantic </i>event classes.</p>
<h2><a name="Event_Sources">Event Sources</a></h2>
<p>All AWT event sources support a <i>multicast </i>model for listeners. This 
means that multiple listeners can be added and removed from a single source. In 
other words, notification of the occurrence of the same event can be sent to one 
or more listener objects. </p>
<p>According to JDK 1.1 documentation, </p>
	<p><em>&quot;The API makes no guarantees about the order in which the events are 
	delivered to a set of registered listeners for a given event on a given 
	source. Additionally, any event which allows its properties to be modified 
	(via setXXX() methods) will be explicitly copied such that each listener 
	receives a replica of the original event. If the order in which events are 
	delivered to listeners is a factor for your program, you should chain the 
	listeners off a single listener which is registered on the source (the fact 
	that the event data is encapsulated in a single object makes propagating the 
	event extremely simple).&quot;</em></p>
	
	<p><strong>Low-level event sources</strong></p>
<p>As before, a distinction is drawn between <i>low-level</i> and <i>
	semantic </i>events. The source for <i>low-level</i> events will often be 
	one of the visual component classes <em>(</em><b><em>Button</em></b><em>,
	</em><b><em>Scrollbar</em></b><em>, etc.)</em> because the event is bound to 
	the actual component on the screen <em>(but counterfeit events can be 
	generated)</em>. </p>
<p>As of February 1997, JDK 1.1 defined low-level listeners on the following 
components. </p>



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Low-level listener components</strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>java.awt.Component<ul>
			<li>addComponentListener(ComponentListener l)</li>
			<li>addFocusListener(FocusListener l)</li>
			<li>addKeyListener(KeyListener l)</li>
			<li>addMouseListener(MouseListener l)</li>
			<li>addMouseMotionListener(MouseMotionListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>java.awt.Container<ul>
			<li>addContainerListener(ContainerListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>java.awt.Dialog<ul>
			<li>addWindowListener(WindowListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>java.awt.Frame<ul>
			<li>addWindowListener(WindowListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

</div>
	<p><strong>Must take inheritance into account</strong></p>
<p>To determine all of the specific event types 
that can be communicated from a source object to a listener object, you must 
take inheritance into account. </p>
<p>For example, as you will see in a sample program 
later in this chapter, a source object can detect <b>mouse events</b> on a <b>
Frame </b>object and notify a <b>MouseListener </b>object of the occurrence of 
those events even though the above list does not show a <b>MouseListener </b>on 
a <b>Frame</b>. This is possible because a <b>Frame </b>object indirectly 
extends the <b>Component </b>class, and <b>MouseListener </b>is defined for the
<b>Component </b>class.</p>
<p><strong>Semantic event sources</strong></p>
<p>As of February 1997, JDK 1.1 defined the following semantic listeners for AWT 
components: </p>



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<p><strong>Semantic listener components</strong></p>
<ul>
		<li>java.awt.Button

		<ul>
			<li><i>addActionListener(ActionListener l)</i></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>java.awt.Choice (implements java.awt.ItemSelectable)
		<ul>
			<li>addItemListener(ItemListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>java.awt.Checkbox (implements java.awt.ItemSelectable)
		<ul>
			<li>addItemListener(ItemListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>java.awt.CheckboxMenuItem (implements java.awt.ItemSelectable)
		<ul>
			<li>addItemListener(ItemListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>java.awt.List (implements java.awt.ItemSelectable)
		<ul>
			<li><i>addActionListener(ActionListener l)</i></li>
			<li>addItemListener(ItemListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>java.awt.MenuItem

		<ul>

			<li>addAdjustmentListener(AdjustmentListener l)</li>
		</ul>

		<li>java.awt.TextArea

		<ul>
			<li>addTextListener(TextListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>java.awt.TextField

		<ul>
			<li><i>addActionListener(ActionListener l)</i></li>
			<li>addTextListener(TextListener l)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

</div>
	<p><strong>The nature of semantic events</strong></p>
<p>The nature of <i>semantic</i> event types can be inferred by noticing that 
in some cases, different types of components support the same type of <i>
semantic</i> event. For example, four different types of components are 
identified in the above list that can register and service <i>action events</i>.</p>
<p>A single <b>ActionEvent</b> listener object could be registered to be 
notified of <i>action events</i> on one or more components of all of these 
types. Of course, it would then be necessary for the code in that event handler 
to determine which source was responsible for generating the event if such 
identification is important.</p>
<p>An important difference between <i>low level</i> events and <i>semantic</i> 
events has to do with where the classes that define those events plug into the 
class hierarchy. <i>Low level</i> events plug in further down the class 
hierarchy and inherit more methods that can be used to process the event object 
than is the case with <i>semantic</i> events.</p>
<h2><a name="adapters">Adapters</a></h2>
	<p>Many <b>EventListener </b>interfaces are designed to listen to multiple 
	event classes. For example, the <b>MouseListener </b>listens to <i>
	mouse-down, mouse-up, mouse-enter</i>, etc. The <b>MouseListener </b>
	interface declares a method for each of these subtypes. </p>
<p>When you implement an interface, you are required to define all of the 
methods that are declared in the interface, even if you define them with empty 
methods. In some cases, the requirement to define all the methods declared in an 
interface can be burdensome. </p>
<p>For this reason (and possibly for some other reasons as well), the AWT 
provides a set of abstract <i>adapter</i> classes that match up with the defined 
interfaces. Each adapter class implements one interface and defines all of the 
methods declared by that interface as empty methods, thus satisfying the 
requirement to define all of the methods. </p>
<p>You can then define your listener classes by <i>extending </i>the adapter 
classes instead of <i>implementing </i>the listener interfaces.. This allows you 
the freedom to override only those methods of the interface that interest you.
</p>
<p>Again, recall that the methods declared within an interface correspond to the 
individual event types contained within a corresponding event class, and the <b>
Source </b>object notifies your <b>Listener </b>object of the occurrence of an 
event of a specific type by calling your interface method. </p>
<p>As of February 1997, the Adapter classes provided by the JDK 1.1 version of 
the AWT were as follows: </p>



<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->

	<h1><a name="Another_Sample_Program">Another Sample Program</a></h1>
<p>The previous program implemented an <b>Event Source</b> object that notified 
two different <b>Listener </b>objects of the occurrence of an event in the <b>
Window </b>class. </p>
<p>The following program implements an <b>Event Source</b> object that notifies 
one <b>Listener </b>object of the occurrence of an event in the <b>Window </b>
class and notifies another <b>Listener </b>object of the occurrence of an event 
in the <b>Mouse </b>class. </p>
<p>This program implements a <b>MouseListener </b>
interface on a <b>Frame </b>object, which is possible because the <b>Frame </b>
class indirectly extends the <b>Component </b>class, and <b>addMouseListener </b>
is defined on the <b>Component </b>class. Thus, <b>addMouseListener </b>
is inherited into the <strong>Frame</strong> class.</p>
<p>A complete listing of this program is shown in <a href="#Listing_16">Listing 
16</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Program output</strong></p>
<p>If you compile and execute this program, whenever you click the mouse inside 
the <b>Frame</b>, you should see the coordinates of the mouse pointer displayed 
above the mouse pointer as shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a> below.</p>
<p><em>(The 0,0 coordinate is the outer edge of the upper-left corner, which is

<pre>class MyFrame extends Frame{
  int clickX;
  int clickY;

  public void paint(Graphics g){
    g.drawString(
             "" + clickX + ", " + clickY, clickX, clickY);

</div>
	<p><strong>Storing and using coordinate information</strong></p>
<p>For future reference, note that this class contains a couple of instance 
variables that will be used to store X and Y coordinate information.</p>
<p>The overridden version of the <b>paint</b> method causes the coordinate 
values stored in <b>clickX</b> and <b>clickY</b> to be displayed in the client 
area of the <b>Frame</b> object at the location specified by the values of those 
two instance variables. </p>
<p><strong>The drawString method</strong></p>
<p>The <b>drawString</b> method requires three parameters. The first parameter is the string to draw on the 
screen. The next two parameters are the coordinate values in pixels where the 
string is to be drawn. </p>
<p>As is normally the case, coordinate values are specified relative to the 
upper left corner of the object being drawn on. The above overridden 
version of the <b>drawString</b> method converts the coordinate values to a 
<strong>String</strong>, and draws that string at the location specified by the coordinate 
values. </p>
<p><strong>The class named GUI</strong></p>
<p>As before, the <b>GUI </b>class is rather long. Therefore, I will break it up 
and discuss it in fragments. </p>
<p>The first fragment that I will discuss is the constructor that begins in
<a href="#Listing_12">Listing 12</a>. The important 
thing to note here is that we are not instantiating an object of type <b>Frame</b>. 
Instead, we are instantiating an object of type <b>MyFrame </b>that is our 
extended version of <b>Frame</b>. </p>
<p>Other than that, you should be familiar with the code in
<a href="#Listing_12">Listing 12</a> by now.</p>

	
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_12">Listing 12</a> - Beginning of the class 
				named GUI.
				</p>
				<pre>class GUI {
  public GUI(){//constructor
    //Create a new Frame object, set size, title, etc.
    MyFrame displayWindow = new MyFrame();
    displayWindow.setSize(300,300);
    displayWindow.setTitle("Copyright, R.G.Baldwin");
    displayWindow.setVisible(true);</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>Register two listener objects</strong></p>
<p><a href="#Listing_13">Listing 13</a> uses standard syntax to instantiate and register two 
different <b>Listener </b>objects on the <b>MyFrame </b>object. The first is a
<b>WindowListener </b>object that will terminate the program when the user 
closes the <b>MyFrame </b>object.</p>
<p>The second is a <b>MouseListener </b>object that will process <i>mouse events</i> 
on the <b>MyFrame </b>object. </p>
<p>It is typical to register listener objects as <em>anonymous objects</em> in those 
cases where a specific reference to the listener object is not otherwise needed.
<em>(Don&#39;t confuse anonymous objects with anonymous classes, which is the topic 
of a future chapter.)</em></p>

	
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_13">Listing 13</a> - Register two listener objects.
				</p>
				<pre>    displayWindow.addWindowListener(new WProc1());
    displayWindow.addMouseListener(
                             new MouseProc(displayWindow));
  }//end constructor
}//end class GUI definition</pre>
</div>
	<p><a href="#Listing_13">Listing 13</a> ends the definition of the <b>GUI </b>class. That 
brings us to the definition of <b>Listener </b>classes for the <b>WindowListener
</b>and the <b>MouseListener</b> interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>The MouseListener class</strong></p>
<p>I will begin with the <b>MouseListener </b>class named <a href="#Listing_14">MouseProc</a>. 
This class <i>
extends </i>the <b>MouseAdapter </b>class and does not directly <i>implement</i> 
the <i>MouseListener </i>interface. This saves us the trouble of having to 
create empty methods for event types that we are not interested in. </p>
<p>Objects of this class that are registered on the <b>Source</b> will be 
notified whenever a <b>mousePressed()</b> event occurs on the <b>Source. </b>
This will cause the <b>mousePressed</b> method to be called. The <b>mousePressed</b> 
method will display the coordinates of the mouse pointer when the mouse is 
pressed on the source object.</p>
<p><strong>The mousePressed method</strong></p>
<p>When the <b>mousePressed</b> method is called, it receives a reference to an object of 
type <b>MouseEvent</b> as a parameter. Different types of events encapsulate 
different types of information in the object that is passed as a parameter to 
the event handler method. This 
particular object contains a variety of information, including the coordinates 
of the mouse pointer when the event occurred. </p>
<p><strong>Extract and save mouse pointer coordinates</strong></p>
<p>The code in the overridden <b>mousePressed()</b> method extracts that 
coordinate information from the object and stores it in the instance variables 
named <b>clickX</b> and <b>clickY</b> of the <b>Source </b>object. </p>
<p>Then it calls the <b>repaint</b> method on the source object, causing the 
source object to be repainted on the screen. This in turn causes the overridden <b>
paint</b> method discussed earlier to be called, which displays the new 
coordinate information on the screen in the proper location. </p>
<p><strong>The class named MouseProc</strong></p>
	<p><a href="#Listing_14">Listing 14</a> contain the definition of the 
	<strong>MouseProc</strong> class, including the overridden <strong>mousePressed</strong> method 
	discussed above.</p>

	
<div class="a">
	<p><a name="Listing_14">Listing 14</a> - The class named MouseProc. </p>
				<pre>class MouseProc extends MouseAdapter{
  MyFrame refToWin; //save a reference to the source here

  MouseProc(MyFrame inWin){//constructor
    refToWin = inWin;//save ref to window
  }//end constructor

  public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e){
    refToWin.clickX = e.getX();
    refToWin.clickY = e.getY();

    refToWin.repaint();
  }//end mousePressed()
}//end class MouseProc</pre>
</div>
	<p><strong>The class named WProc1</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we come to the class that is used to instantiate a listener object 
that terminates the program when the user closes the <b>MyFrame </b>object <em>
(see <a href="#Listing_15">Listing 15</a>)</em>. You 
will be seeing this class over and over as you review the sample programs in 
upcoming chapters. </p>

				<pre>class WProc1 extends WindowAdapter{
  public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e){
    System.exit(0);
  }//end windowClosing()
}//end class WProc1</pre>
</div>
	<p>The <strong>WProc1</strong> class extends the <strong>WindowAdapter</strong> 
	class and overrides the method named <strong>windowClosing</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>windowClosing</strong> method is called when the user clicks the 
red X in the upper right corner of <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>.That causes 
the static <strong>exit</strong> method of the <strong>System</strong> class to 
be called, which in turn causes the program to terminate.</p>

This program is designed to be compiled under JDK 1.1

Illustrates the use of Event Sources, Event Listeners, and
Adapters in the Delegation Event Model.

This program instantiates a Listener object to process
mouse events. When a mouse press occurs in a Frame object,
the program gets the coordinates and then displays those
coordinates near the point of the mouse press.

This program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95.

	<h1><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p>In the simplest case, you can handle events as defined in JDK 1.1 with the following steps.</p>
<h2><a name="Step_1">Step 1</a></h2>
<p>Define a <b>Listener </b>class for a specific class of events by either <i>
implementing </i>the listener interface that matches that class of events, or <i>
extending </i>the corresponding adapter class.</p>
<h2><a name="Step_2">Step 2</a></h2>
<p>Define or override the interface methods in the <b>Listener </b>class, for 
each specific event type in the event class, to implement the desired behavior 
of the program upon occurrence of an event. </p>
<p>If you <i>implement </i>the listener interface, you must define all interface 
methods. If instead you <i>extend </i>the corresponding adapter class, you can 
override only those methods that tie to event types of interest.</p>
<h2><a name="Step_3">Step 3</a></h2>
<p>Write code that instantiates objects of the <b>Source </b>class and the
<b>Listener </b>class and <i>registers </i>the listener object on the source 
object for notification of events generated by the source 
object.</p>
<p>You can use code such as the following for registration:</p>
<p>displayWindow.<b>addMouseListener</b>(mouseProcCmd);</p>
<p>In this code fragment,</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>displayWindow</b> is a reference to the object that fires the event,</li>
	<li><b>mouseProcCmd</b> is the name of a reference to the listener object, and</li>
	<li><b>addMouseListener </b>is the method that registers the listener object 
	to receive mouse events from the object referred to by <b>displayWindow</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This statement will cause the object named <b>mouseProcCmd</b> to be notified of 
all events generated by <b>displayWindow</b> which are part of the class of <i>
mouse</i> events.</p>
<p>The notification takes the form of calling a method in the <b>mouseProcCmd</b> 
object where there must be a corresponding method for each specific event type 
in the class of <i>mouse</i> events. <em>(Some of those methods can be empty 
shells if you have no interest in some of the event types).</em></p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this is the procedure for the simplest cases. It is 
possible to make the situation more complicated. For example, a single <b>Source </b>object 
can be required to notify two or more different <b>Listener </b>
objects of the occurrence of an event of the same class on a single screen 
object. </p>
<p>The <b>Source </b>object can also be required to notify two 
or more different <b>Listener </b>objects of the occurrence of events of two different 
classes on a single screen object. </p>
<p>A single <b>Listener </b>object can be registered 
to receive notification of the occurrence of events of a given class on more 
than one source object. In that case, it is normally necessary for the code in 
the <b>Listener </b>object to crack open the event object to determine which 
screen object was responsible for the event <em>(if it matters)</em>. </p>
<p>Also, the JDK 1.1 documentation indicates that it is possible to have 
event-style communication between objects that are not screen objects. 
Subsequent chapters will investigate a number of these possibilities.</p>
