<h1><a name="preface"></a>Preface</h1>
<p>This chapter is one in a collection of chapters designed for teaching <em>
ITSE2317 - Java Programming (Intermediate)</em> at Austin Community College in 
Austin, TX.
</p><p><em>(Author's note: As you read this chapter, you will see that it was 
originally written around 1997. However, despite many improvements in Java since 
then, most of what was true then is still true in 2020.)</em></p>
<h1><span class="auto-style3"><a name="introduction"></a></span>
<span class="auto-style2">Introduction</span></h1>
JDK 1.1 was formally released on February 18, 1997. This chapter was originally 
written on February 27, 1997 using the software and documentation in JDK 1.1.

<p>One of the new features in JDK 1.1 is the capability to create <i>inner 
classes</i> and also to use an abbreviated syntax for the
<i>definition of anonymous classes</i> and the <i>instantiation of anonymous 
objects</i> from those classes.

</p><p>The instantiation of <b>Listener </b>objects is a strong candidate for the 
use of anonymous classes and objects as provided by the <i>inner class</i>
capability.

</p><p>The purpose of this chapter is simply to introduce you to the 
concept so that you will know what you are seeing whenever you encounter 
code using the abbreviated <i>inner class </i>syntax.

</p><p>Two sample programs will be presented and discussed. The first will be 
implemented using Inner Classes, but will not use the anonymous class, 
anonymous object syntax.

</p><p>Then the same program will be presented after having been modified to
use the anonymous class, anonymous object syntax.

</p><p>This will make it possible for you to compare the two and hopefully 
gain a better understanding the abbreviated syntax version.

</p><p>The topic of <i>inner classes</i> is a broad topic. The discussion of the 
technical aspects of inner classes will be very brief. Also there are 
many aspects of inner classes that won't be discussed even briefly.

</p><p>You may need to refer to either the documentation package to fully understand the material 
presented in this chapter.

</p><p>According to the JDK 1.1 Documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
	"Inner classes allow classes to be defined in any scope. In previous 
	releases, Java supported only top-level classes, which must be members of 
	packages. In this release, the programmer can now define inner classes as 
	members of other classes, locally within a block of statements, or 
	(anonymously) within an expression."</blockquote>

<h1><a name="first the sample program"></a>First 
Sample Program</h1>
As mentioned earlier, in order to avoid some of the cryptic aspects of anonymous 
classes/objects, the first sample program makes use of inner classes in a 
relatively straightforward manner. Classes are defined inside of classes and 
those class definitions are used to instantiate the necessary objects.

<p>This differs significantly from previous chapters on the Delegation Event 
Model where the classes needed to instantiate <b>Listener </b>objects were 
top-level classes <em>(direct subclasses of the class </em> <b><em>object</em></b><em> or subclasses of 
</em> <b>
<em>adapter</em></b><em> classes such as </em> <b><em>MouseAdapter</em></b><em>).

</em>

</p><p>In this program, the classes needed to instantiate <b>Listener </b>objects, 
as well as some others are nested within other classes.</p>
<h2><a name="discussion of first sample program"></a>
Discussion of First Sample Program</h2><p>This program combines the use of inner classes with 
event handling under the JDK 1.1 Delegation Event Handling model.

</p><p>The controlling class is named Event23. An inner class 
named <b>GUI </b>is defined inside the class named <b>Event23 </b>and an object 
of that class is instantiated inside the <b>main()</b> method.

</p><p>In addition, two "data processing" methods named
<b>sing()</b> and <b>whistle()</b> are defined inside the controlling class. 
They are defined in such a way as to be separated from the event handling 
activity except that they are invoked by the event handler methods.

</p><p>Three additional inner classes are defined 
inside the inner class named <b>GUI</b>. They are named <b>SingActionListener</b>,
<b>WhistleActionListener</b>, and <b>Terminator</b>. All three of these are <b>
Listener </b>classes. The first two implement the <b>ActionListener
</b>interface while the third extends the <b>WindowListener </b>adapter.

</p><p>The first two override the <b>actionPerformed()</b>
method of the <b>ActionListener </b>interface while the third overrides the <b>
windowClosing()</b> method of the <b>WindowListener </b>interface.

</p><p>The class named <b>GUI </b>extends <b>Frame</b>. Two <b>
Button </b>objects labeled <i>Sing </i>and <i>Whistle </i>are instantiated in 
the <b>GUI </b>constructor. They are referenced by variables named <b>singButton
</b>and <b>whistleButton </b>respectively. Both buttons are added to the
<b>Frame </b>object.

</p><p>Although this sample program does not use anonymous 
classes, it does use anonymous objects. Anonymous <b>Listener </b>objects 
of the classes <b>SingActionListener </b>and <b>WhistleActionListener </b>are 
instantiated and registered for event handling on the <b>Button
</b>objects having similar names.

</p><p>Another anonymous <b>Listener </b>object of the class <b>
Terminator </b>is registered for event handling on the <b>Frame
</b>object of class <b>GUI</b>.

</p><p>When the program starts, a <b>Frame </b>object 
containing the two buttons appears on the screen. When the user clicks on the 
button labeled <i>Sing</i>, the event handler registered to listen for <b>Action </b>

Revised 9/17/97
This program is designed to be compiled and run under
JDK 1.1

The program illustrates the use of Inner Classes with event
handling under the JDK 1.1 Delegation Event Handling model.

The controlling class is named Event23. An Inner Class
named GUI is defined inside the class named Event23 and an
object of that class is instantiated inside the main()
method.

In addition, two "data processing" methods named sing() and
whistle() are defined inside the controlling class. They
are defined in such a way as to be separated from the event
handling activity except that they are invoked by the event
handler methods.

Three more Inner Classes are defined inside the Inner Class
named GUI. They are named SingActionListener,
WhistleActionListener, and Terminator. All three of these
are Listener classes. The first two implement the
ActionListener interface while the third extends the
WindowListener adapter.

The first two override the actionPerformed() method of the
ActionListener interface while the third overrides the
windowClosing() method of the WindowListener interface.

The class named GUI extends Frame. Two Button objects
labeled Sing and Whistle are instantiated in the GUI
constructor. They are referenced by variables named
singButton and whistleButton respectively. Both buttons
are added to the Frame object.

Anonymous Listener objects of the classes
SingActionListener and WhistleActionListener are
instantiated and registered for event handling on the two
Button objects having similar names.

An anonymous Listener object of the class Terminator is
registered for event handling on the Frame object of class
GUI.

When the program starts, a Frame object containing the two
buttons appears on the screen. When the user clicks on the
button labeled Sing, the event handler registered to
listen for Action events on that button invokes the method
named sing() causing the message

"I am singing, Tra la la"

to be displayed on the screen.

When the user clicks on the button labeled Whistle, the
event handler registered to listen for Action events on
that button invokes the method named whistle() causing the
message

"I am whistling, Tweet, Tweet, Tweet"

to be displayed on the screen.

When the user clicks the "close" box on the Frame, the
event handler registered to listen for windowClosing()
events on the Frame terminates the program.

This version uses long form notation as opposed to the use
of anonymous inner classes. See the program named Event22
for a version that uses the more cryptic abbreviated
notation attributable to the use of anonymous inner
classes.

These results were produced using JDK 12.0.1 running under
Windows 7.

<h1><a name="second sample program"></a>Second 
Sample Program</h1>
The second sample program is similar to the first, except that it makes 
use of anonymous classes for instantiation of the <b>Listener
</b>objects.
<h2><a name="discussion of second sample program"></a>
Discussion of Second Sample Program</h2>In 
order to make small adapter classes (such as <b>Listener
</b>classes) as concise as possible, Java 1.1 allows an abbreviated notation for 
local objects.

<p>A single expression combines</p><ul><li>
	the definition of an anonymous class with</li>

<li>the allocation of the instance.</li></ul>
<p>Here is a code fragment from the second sample program which illustrates this 
concept.</p>

<div class="a"><pre>singButton.addActionListener(
 <b>new ActionListener()</b>{
 public void <b>actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)</b>{
 <b>sing();//call</b> the sing() method
 }//end actionPerformed()
 }//end ActionListener
 );//end addActionListener()</pre></div>In this case, the 
code defines a new anonymous class that automatically implements the <b>
ActionListener </b>interface <em>(without use of the keyword </em> <b><em>implements</em></b>) 
and automatically instantiates an anonymous object of that new class.

<p>In this case, the word <i>anonymous </i>indicates that 
neither the class nor the object are named.

</p><p>In previous chapters we have instantiated anonymous 
objects by using the <b>new</b> operator and making a call to the constructor 
for the object as part of a larger overall expression. However, we have not done 
that using classes that had no name.

</p><p>Another interesting aspect of this syntax is the 
following code fragment which looks like a constructor call in a typical object 
instantiation.</p>
<div class="a"><pre><b>new ActionListener()</b>{...</pre></div>
<p>However, <b>ActionListener </b>is not a class, it is an interface and since an 
interface cannot contain any fully defined methods, it doesn't seem that it 
could have a constructor (but it works anyway).

</p>

<p>Pay particular attention to the positions of the
open and close parentheses which define the argument list for the
<b>addActionListener()</b> method.

</p><p>The definition of the anonymous class as well as 
the instantiation of the anonymous object are both included in the 
argument list of <b>addActionListener()</b>.

</p><p>The addActionListener<b>()</b> method is used to 
register this anonymous object to listen for <b>actionPerformed()</b>
events on the <b>Button </b>object named <b>singButton</b>. Whenever an
<b>Action </b>event occurs on that specific button, the overridden <b>
actionPerformed()</b>
method invokes the "data processing" method named <b>sing()</b>. Because this is 
an inner-class of the outer-class in which the method <b>sing()</b>
is defined, code in the inner-class has direct access to the method named
<b>sing() </b>without the requirement to instantiate an object of the 
outer-class.

</p><p>When using the abbreviated syntax, a <b>new</b>
operator expression can end with a class body. According to the JDK 1.1 
documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
	"The effect of this is to 
	take the class (or interface) named after the <b>new </b>token, and subclass 
	it (or implement it) with the given body. The resulting anonymous 
	inner-class has the same meaning as if the programmer had defined it 
	locally, with a name, in the current block of statements."</blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that an anonymous
class can have initializers but it <strong>cannot have a constructor</strong>. The 
argument list of the associated <b>new </b>expression is implicitly passed to a 
constructor of the superclass.

</p>

<p>For the second sample program which follows, the 
controlling class is named <b>Event22</b>. As before, an inner class named
<b>GUI </b>is defined inside the class named <b>Event22 </b>and an object of 
that class is instantiated inside the <b>main()</b> method.

</p><p>Also as before, two "data processing" methods named <b>
sing()</b> and <b>whistle()</b> are defined inside the controlling class. They 
are defined in such a way as to be separated from the event handling activity 
except that they are invoked by the event handler methods.

</p><p>However, unlike the first sample program, 
abbreviated notation is used to anonymously define the classes for and 
instantiate three anonymous listener objects inside the inner class named <b>GUI</b>. 
The first two implement the <b>ActionListener </b>interface while the third 
extends the <b>WindowListener </b>adapter class.

</p><p>As before, the first two override the <b>
actionPerformed()
</b>method of the <b>ActionListener </b>interface while the third overrides the <b>
windowClosing()</b> method of the <b>WindowListener </b>interface.

</p><p>The class named <b>GUI </b>extends <b>Frame</b>. Two <b>
Button </b>objects labeled <i>Sing </i>and <i>Whistle </i>are instantiated in 
the <b>GUI </b>constructor. They are referenced by variables named <b>singButton
</b>and <b>whistleButton </b>respectively. Both buttons are added to the
<b>Frame </b>object.

</p><p>The first two anonymous listener objects mentioned 
above are registered to listen for <b>actionPerformed()</b> events on the 
two buttons. The third anonymous listener object is registered
to listen for <b>windowClosing() </b>events on the <b>Frame </b>object.

</p><p>When the program starts, a <b>Frame </b>object 
containing the two buttons appears on the screen. When the user clicks
on the button labeled <i>Sing</i>, the event handler registered to listen for <b>
Action </b>events on that button invokes the method named <b>sing()</b>
which displays the message:

</p><p><b>"I am singing, Tra la la"</b>

</p><p>When the user clicks on the button labeled <i>Whistle</i>, 
the event handler registered to listen for <b>Action </b>events on that button 
invokes the method named <b>whistle()</b> which displays the message:

</p><p><b>"I am whistling, Tweet, Tweet, Tweet"</b>

</p><p>When the user clicks the "close" box on the <b>Frame</b>, 
the event handler registered to listen for <b>windowClosing()</b> events on the 
<strong>Frame</strong> terminates the program.

Program Listing of Second Sample Program</h2>
<p>A program listing with additional comments follows:</p>
<div class="a"><pre>/*File Event22.java Copyright, R.G.Baldwin
Revised 9/17/97
This program is designed to be compiled and run under
JDK 1.1

The program illustrates the use of Inner Classes with event
handling under the JDK 1.1 Delegation Event Handling model.

The use of anonymous Inner Classes is also illustrated.
See the program named Event23 for an example of Inner
Classes that does not use anonymous Inner Classes.

The controlling class is named Event22. An Inner Class
named GUI is defined inside the class named Event22 and an
object of that class is instantiated inside the main()
method.

In addition, two "data processing" methods named sing() and
whistle() are defined inside the controlling class named
Event22. They are defined in such a way as to be separated
from the event handling activity except that they are
invoked by the event handler methods.

Abbreviated notation is used to anonymously define the
classes for and instantiate three anonymous listener
objects inside the Inner Class named GUI. The first two
implement the ActionListener interface while the third
extends the WindowListener adapter.

The first two implement the actionPerformed() method of the
ActionListener interface while the third overrides the
windowClosing() method of the WindowListener interface.

The class named GUI extends Frame. Two Button objects
labeled Sing and Whistle are instantiated in the GUI
constructor. They are referenced by variables named
singButton and whistleButton respectively. Both buttons
are added to the Frame object.

The first two anonymous listener objects mentioned above
are registered to listen for actionPerformed() events on
the two buttons respectively. The third anonymous listener
object is registered to listen for windowClosing() events
on the Frame object.

When the program starts, a Frame object containing the two
buttons appears on the screen. When the user clicks on the
button labeled Sing, the event handler registered to listen
for Action events on that button invokes the method named
sing() causing the message

"I am singing, Tra la la"

to be displayed on the screen.

When the user clicks one the button labeled Whistle, the
event handler registered to listen for Action events on
that button invokes the method named whistle() causing the
message

"I am whistling, Tweet, Tweet, Tweet"

to be displayed on the screen.

When the user clicks the "close" box on the Frame, the
event handler registered to listen for windowClosing()
events on the Frame terminates the program.

This version of the program uses abbreviated notation to
define anonymous classes and instantiate anonymous listener
objects. The abbreviated notation is fairly cryptic. See
the program named Event23 for a version that does the same
thing without using the abbreviated notation.

These results were produced using JDK 1.1 running under
Windows 95.

<p>Q - Without viewing the solution given below, write a Java application that 
meets the following specifications:
</p>
<div class="a"><pre>The program must be written using the following skeleton
and inserting any additional code that may be necessary.


<b>import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class SampProg128 extends Frame{
//All new code must be inserted after this comment

//Insert the necessary additional code here.

<i>//Do not define any named classes other than the class
// named SampProg128

</i>//All new code must be inserted before this comment
}//end class SampProg128

</b>
When the program starts, a Frame object containing a button
labeled Button and a label containing the string
Initial Text in Label appears on the screen. Your name
must appear in the title at the top of the frame. When the
user clicks the button, the text in the label changes to
Ouch.

When the user clicks the "close" box on the Frame, the
program terminates and control is properly returned to the
operating system.</pre></div>

<p>A - See the 
solution below:</p>
