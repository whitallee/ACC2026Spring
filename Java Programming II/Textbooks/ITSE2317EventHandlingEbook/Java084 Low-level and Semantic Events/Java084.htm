<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>An earlier chapter briefly discussed the differences between <em>low-level</em> 
events and <em>semantic</em> events as described in the JDK 1.1 documentation.</p>
<p>This chapter takes another look at that topic through the use of 
programs that apply both <em>low-level</em> event handling and <em>semantic </em>
event handling to the same set of visual components. This makes it possible to 
compare the two types of events in a more meaningful way. </p>
	<h1 class="style1"><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h1>
<p>Although the suite of <em>semantic </em>events is generally used for 
different purposes than the suite of <em>low-level</em> events, from a practical 
programming viewpoint, there is very little difference. </p>
<p>The primary difference appears to reside in the nature of the event object 
that is passed to the event handler when an event occurs. </p>
<p>Using the information in the event object, <em>low-level</em> events can gain 
access to the specific <strong>Component</strong> object that generated the 
event. </p>
<p>Given a <em>low-level</em> event object, the <strong>getComponent</strong> 
method of the <strong>java.awt.event.ComponentEvent</strong> class will return a 
reference to the actual object that generated the event. </p>
<p>Once that reference is available, there are literally dozens of methods of the
<strong>Component</strong> class that can be invoked on the object, such as
<strong>getLocation, getLocationOnScreen, getMaximumSize, getMinimumSize, 
getName,</strong> etc. </p>
<p>A sample program in a previous chapter invoked the <strong>getName</strong> 
method on such an object to determine which object among several objects 
generated a low-level mouse event. </p>
<p>A sample program that we will see later in this chapter invokes some of the 
other available methods on such a component object. </p>
<p>All <em>low-level</em> event classes are subclasses of the <strong>
java.awt.event.ComponentEvent </strong>class, so the event handlers for all <em>
low-level</em> events have access to the object that generated the event. </p>
<p>Semantic events, on the other hand, do not subclass the <strong>
ComponentEvent</strong> class. Rather, they subclass the superclass of <strong>
ComponentEvent</strong> making them siblings of <strong>ComponentEvent</strong>.
</p>
<p>Because they do not subclass <strong>ComponentEvent</strong>, the event 
objects passed into semantic event handlers do not provide a way to obtain a 
reference to the object that generated the event, and therefore cannot invoke 
the methods of the <strong>Component </strong>class on that object. </p>
<p>Whether this is important or not depends on your needs. For example, if you needed to determine the location of the object that 
generated an event, you could determine that location by processing a <em>
low-level</em> event but you <em>(probably)</em> could not determine that location by 
processing a <em>semantic </em>event.</p>
<p>Regardless of the ability to access the object that generated the event, the 
name of that object is readily available to the event handlers of both <em>
low-level</em> and <em>semantic</em> events. </p>
<p>In both cases, the name of the object is encapsulated in the event object 
passed as a parameter and can be extracted or tested using methods of the
<strong>String </strong>class. Often knowing the name of the object is 
sufficient to accomplish the desired result. </p>

This program is designed to be compiled and run
under JDK 1.1

The program demonstrates the object-manipulation capability
of low-level events.

A Button object and a TextField object are placed in a
Frame object.

A MouseListener object is instantiated and registered to
monitor for low-level mousePressed() events on all three
objects.  Whenever a mousePressed() event occurs, the
Listener object obtains and displays several pieces of
information about the object that generated the event.
Although this demonstration program only obtains and
displays information as a result of mousePressed() events,
all of the methods of the Component class are available for
use at that point.  Thus the code in the event handler
method could also modify some of the attributes of the
object that generated the event.

Finally, a WindowListener object is instantiated and
registered to terminate the program when the user closes
the Frame object.

Starting the program and then clicking successively on the
Button, the TextField, and the interior of the Frame
produces the following output.

Name = Button1
Parent's name = Frame
Location = java.awt.Point[x=4,y=23]
Minimum Size = java.awt.Dimension[width=54,height=21]
Size = java.awt.Dimension[width=192,height=21]

Name = TextField1
Parent's name = Frame
Location = java.awt.Point[x=4,y=275]
Minimum Size = java.awt.Dimension[width=104,height=21]
Size = java.awt.Dimension[width=192,height=21]

Name = Frame

Location = java.awt.Point[x=0,y=0]
Minimum Size = java.awt.Dimension[width=112,height=69]
Size = java.awt.Dimension[width=200,height=300]


These results were produced using JDK 1.1.3, under Win95.

Revised 02/13/04 to correct an error in the comments.

This program is designed to be compiled and run
under JDK 1.1

The program supports experimentation with low-level events
and semantic events.

A Button object and a TextField object are placed in a
Frame object.

An ActionListener object is instantiated and registered to
monitor for semantic actionPerformed()events on the Button
and the TextField.

An actionPerformed() event can be generated on a TextField
by pressing the Enter key while the TextField object has
the focus.

An actionPerformed() event can be generated by a Button by
clicking on it with the mouse.

An action event cannot be generated by a Frame object.

Whenever an actionPerformed() event occurs, the Listener
object invokes the getActionCommand() method on the object
to obtain the "command name".

The getActionCommand() method returns the "command name"
associated with the action as a String.  The string is
displayed.  As it turns out, the "command name" associated
with a Button is simply the text, caption, or label on the
button.  The "command name" associated with a TextField is
the current text content of the TextField object.

The ActionEvent object passed to the actionPerformed()
method includes the name of the component which can be
used in a conditional test based on the indexOf() method
of the String class to identify the component that
generated the event.

Each time the actionPerformed() method is invoked, code in
the body of the method uses the indexOf() method to
identify the component that generated the event and
displays a message identifying that component.

A FocusListener object is instantiated and registered to
monitor for low-level focusGained() and focusLost() events
on the Button and the TextField.

Whenever a focusGained() event occurs, a message is
displayed identifying the object which gained the focus.
Likewise, whenever a focusLost() event occurs, a message is
displayed identifying the object which lost the focus.  The
object that gained or lost focus is identified by
performing conditional tests on the FocusEvent object
passed in as a parameter.

A MouseListener object is instantiated and registered to
monitor for low-level mousePressed() events on all three
objects.  The Listener object differentiates among the
three on the basis of the component name assigned to each
object.  The approach used to obtain the component name in
this program uses the indexOf() method of the String class
on the MouseEvent object.  This is a somewhat less complex
approach than the approach used to obtain the component
name for a mousePressed() event in an earlier chapter.  When
a mousePressed() event occurs on any of the three visual
objects, the Listener object displays a message identifying
the object that generated the event.

Finally, a WindowListener object is instantiated and
registered to terminate the program when the user closes
the Frame object.

Typical outputs from the program follow:


Clicking the mouse inside the frame but outside of both the
TextField and the Button produces the following output:

Got mousePressed event from Frame object


Clicking the mouse on the TextField when the Button has the
focus produces the following output:

Got mousePressed event from TextField1 object
Got focusLost event from Button1 object
Got focusGained event from TextField1 object


Pressing the Enter key when the TextField has the focus
produces the following output:

e.getActionCommand() = Initial String
Got actionPerformed event from TextField1 object


Clicking the mouse on the Button when the TextField has the
focus produces the following output:

Got mousePressed event from Button1 object
Got focusLost event from TextField1 object
Got focusGained event from Button1 object
e.getActionCommand() = Click me
Got actionPerformed event from Button1 object


These results were produced using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95.

</div>




<p>As before, a <strong>Button </strong>object and a <strong>TextField </strong>
object are placed at the top and bottom respectively of a <strong>Frame </strong>
object with some space in between. </p>
<p><em>Semantic </em>event handling is provided in this program for <strong>Action </strong>
events. <em>Low-level</em> event handling is provided on the same components for
<strong>mousePressed</strong> events and <strong>Focus</strong> events. </p>

<h2><a name="Focus_events">Focus events</a></h2>
<p>In Java, a component has the <em>focus</em> when it can accept keyboard input. 
There are a variety of ways by which the focus can move from one component to 
another. Whenever it moves, one component generates a <strong>focusLost</strong> 
event and the other component generates a <strong>focusGained</strong> event.
</p>
<p>There are also some issues involving <em>temporary</em> and <em>permanent</em> 
changes in focus which aren't discussed here, but can be found in the JDK 1.1 
documentation. </p>
<p>On the basis of the above description, you should see that there are many 
different types of components that can generate a focus event. Any component 
that can gain the focus can generate such an event. </p>
<p>There are some components such as <strong>Button </strong>objects and <strong>
TextField </strong>objects that automatically gain the focus when they are 
clicked on by the mouse. There are other components such as <strong>Label
</strong>objects that do not automatically gain the focus when they are clicked 
on by the mouse. However, even these components can gain the focus by <em>
requesting </em>it. We will investigate this in more detail in a future 
chapter. </p>
<h2><a name="Action_events">Action events</a></h2>
<p>An action event can also be generated by many different types of components. For 
example, clicking a button or pressing the <em>Enter</em> key while a <strong>TextField</strong> 
object has the focus will generate an action event. The terminology derives from 
the notion that those user actions that generate action events are 
messages to the program to take the specific action indicated by the nature of 
the component.
</p>
<p>For example, if a button is labeled <strong>Exit</strong> and it is clicked by the 
user, that means that the user is expecting an action that can be interpreted as
<em>exit</em> in that context. </p>
<h2><a name="ActionListener_object">ActionListener object</a></h2>
<p>In this program an <strong>ActionListener</strong> object is instantiated and 
registered to monitor for semantic <strong>actionPerformed</strong> 
events on the <strong>Button </strong>and the <strong>TextField</strong>.
</p>
<p>When an <strong>actionPerformed</strong> event is generated, certain 
information regarding the event is encapsulated into an object that is passed to 
the <strong>actionPerformed</strong> method of the listener object. This 
information includes what the JDK 1.1 documentation refers to as a <em>command 
name</em>. This information can be accessed by the code in the method by 
invoking the <strong>getActionCommand</strong> method on the object. In this 
program, the <em>command name</em> is accessed and displayed on the screen. </p>
<p>As it turns out, the default "command name" associated with a <strong>Button </strong>
is simply the <em>text</em>, <em>caption</em>, or <em>label </em>on the button 
<em>(whatever you choose to call it).</em> The "command name" associated with a<strong> 
TextField</strong> is the current text content of the <strong>TextField</strong> object. </p>
<p>This information would have different uses for different components in 
different situations. For example, it might be used to distinguish among several 
buttons if the captions on the buttons were not allowed to change during the 
execution of the program. It might be used to extract user input from a <strong>
TextField </strong>object. </p>
<p>The object of type <strong>ActionEvent</strong> passed to the <strong>
actionPerformed</strong> method also includes the name of the component, which 
can be used in a conditional test to identify the component that generated the 
event. One way to do this is through use of the <strong>indexOf</strong> 
method of the <strong>String </strong>class to determine if a given component 
name is included in a specific object. </p>
<p>In this program, each time the <strong>actionPerformed</strong> method is 
invoked, code in the body of the method uses the <strong>indexOf</strong> 
method to identify the component that generated the event and displays a message 
identifying that component. </p>
<h2><a name="FocusListener_object">FocusListener object</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>FocusListener </strong>object is instantiated and registered to 
monitor for <em>low-level </em><strong>focusGained</strong> and <strong>
focusLost</strong> events on the <strong>Button </strong>and the <strong>
TextField</strong>.</p>
<p>Whenever a <strong>focusGained</strong> event occurs, a message is 
displayed identifying the object that gained the focus. </p>
<p>Likewise, whenever a <strong>focusLost</strong> event occurs, a message is 
displayed identifying the object that lost the focus. </p>
<p>The object that gained or lost the focus is identified by performing 
conditional tests on the <strong>FocusEvent </strong>object passed in as a 
parameter in the same manner that the <strong>ActionEvent</strong> object is 
used for action events. </p>
<h2><a name="MouseListener_object">MouseListener object</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>MouseListener </strong>object is instantiated and registered to 
monitor for <em>low-level</em> <strong>mousePressed</strong> events on all 
three objects. <em>(Note that there are numerous other low-level mouse 
events that could be monitored but they were omitted in for the sake of 
simplicity.)
</em></p>
<p>The <strong>MouseListener</strong> object differentiates among the three 
objects <em>(</em><strong><em>Frame</em></strong><em>, </em> <strong><em>Button</em></strong><em>, and 
</em> <strong><em>TextField</em></strong>) 
on the basis of the component name assigned to each object when it is 
instantiated. </p>
<p>If the programmer does not assign names to the components when they are 
instantiated, they are automatically assigned by the system, and are probably 
unique. The names that are automatically assigned have the format <em>frame0, 
frame1, frame2</em>, etc., with the main body of the name identifying the type 
of component, and the digit at the end being assigned in the order in which the 
components are instantiated. A clever programmer should be able to find a way to 
obtain and make use of those names as an alternative to assigning her own names.
</p>
<p>The approach used to obtain the component name in this program uses the
<strong>indexOf</strong> method of the <strong>String </strong>class on the
<strong>MouseEvent </strong>object. <em>(This is a slightly less complex approach 
than the approach used to obtain the component name for a </em> <strong><em>mousePressed</em></strong><em> 
event in an earlier chapter which went all the way back to the component object 
and invoked the </em> <strong><em>getName</em></strong><em> method.)</em> </p>
<p>When a <strong>mousePressed</strong> event occurs on any of the three visual 
objects, the <strong>MouseListener </strong>object displays a message 
identifying the object that generated the event. </p>
<h2><a name="WindowListener_object">WindowListener object</a></h2>
<p>Finally, a <strong>WindowListener </strong>object is instantiated and 
registered to terminate the program when the user closes the <strong>Frame
</strong>object. </p>
<h2><a name="More_general_comments_about_the_program">More general comments 
about the program</a></h2>
<p>The screen output for a number of different user actions is shown in the 
comments at the beginning of the program. This material illustrates how the <em>
action, focus, </em>and<em> mousePressed</em> events behave during normal user 
interaction with the program.
</p>
<p>In order to maintain simplicity, the response to events in this program is 
limited to simply displaying information. Obviously, once control is within an 
event handler, more significant behavior in response to an event can be programmed.
</p>
<p>This program illustrates the fact that a single user action can cause 
many different types of events to be generated. </p>
<p>One thing to notice in particular is that since this program was not designed 
to manipulate the objects that generated the <em>low-level</em> events, there is 
very little difference in the handling of <em>low-level</em> events and <em>
semantic</em> events. However, the handling would have been significantly 
different if the capability to manipulate the objects that generated the events 
had been exercised <em>(as in the previous program).</em> </p>

 Without viewing the following solution, write a Java
 application that originally displays a Frame object
 containing a button at the top and a TextField object
 at the bottom.

 Cause the TextField to have red letters on a yellow
 background.

 When you click on the TextField object, it disappears.
 When you click on the Button object, the TextField object
 reappears.

 Use only low level events.

 When you click on the close button in the upper right-hand
 corner of the Frame object, the program terminates and
 control is properly returned to the operating system.
