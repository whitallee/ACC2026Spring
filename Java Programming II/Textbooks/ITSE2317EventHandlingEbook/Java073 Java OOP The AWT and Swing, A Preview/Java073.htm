	<p>This chapter is part of a collection of chapters designed to teach you about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. </p>
<p><em>(Author's note: As you will see when you read this chapter, the original 
version was written about twenty-two years ago. However, despite numerous 
improvements that have occurred in Java since then, most of what was true on 
this topic in 1998 is still true in 2020. A wise man once said, &quot;If it ain&#39;t 
broke, don&#39;t fix it.&quot; </em></p>
<p><em>One of the changes that you will see in subsequent chapters is that the 
name of the package that contains the <strong>Swing</strong> classes has been 
changed to <strong>javax.swing</strong>.)</em></p>
	<h1 class="auto-style2"><a name="Discussion_and_sample_code">Discussion</a></h1>

<p>This chapter provides a very brief preview of some of what you can 
expect to find in subsequent chapters regarding the Abstract Windows Toolkit (<b>AWT</b>) 
and the <b>Swing</b> component set. </p>
<p>The user interface of a modern computer program often involves techniques to 
activate many of the human senses. We use <i>icons, text boxes, images, sound, 
boardroom graphics, etc.</i> </p>
<p>We weren&#39;t too concerned with these aspects of 
programming in the prerequisite course <em>(ITSE 2321)</em> because there was a lot that you needed to learn to prepare yourself 
for understanding material of this sort. That is about to change. </p>
<p>Much of the actual programming that you will do with Java will involve those 
aspects of the interface that we commonly refer to as the <b>Graphical User 
Interface (GUI)</b>. </p>
<p>As of 5/10/98, there are two primary packages that are used for <b>GUI </b>

programming under JDK 1.1.6:</p>
<ol>
	<li>java.<b>awt</b>.*</li>
	<li>com.sun.java.<b>swing</b>.*</li>
</ol>
<p>There are, of course, numerous other packages that are used in support of 
these two packages. </p>
<p>The <b>AWT</b> material was made available to Java programmers early in the 
life of Java. This was the original material that was used to create graphical 
user interfaces. Major improvements to the <b>AWT</b> were introduced with the 
release of JDK 1.1. </p>
<p>The <b>Swing</b> components became available in released form for use with 
JDK 1.1 around the beginning of 1998. These components added significantly to 
the ability of the programmer to create GUIs, both in terms of functionality and 
cosmetics. </p>
<p>The capability and cosmetics of the <strong>AWT</strong> were very limited but <b>Swing</b> 
made GUI programming in Java competitive in the real world. A Java programmer no 
longer needs to apologize for the quality of the GUIs that she can create. </p>
<p>We expect that these two packages may become more integrated (causing changes 
in your <b>import</b> directives) with the release of JDK 1.2, <em>(probably 
sometime in 1998)</em> but hopefully the concepts involved won&#39;t be greatly 
different. </p>
<p>As of 3/5/97, there were more than fifty classes defined in package <b>
java.awt</b>. We will discuss some of the more important <b>AWT</b> classes in 
subsequent chapters. </p>
<p>As of 5/10/98, the <i>com.sun.java.swing</i> package contains more than 75 
classes and about 20 interfaces. You might expect, therefore, that learning to 
use this material effectively won&#39;t be a trivial task. </p>
<p>It is very important to understand that <b>Swing</b> is an extension of, and
not a replacement for the <strong>AWT</strong>. While it is true that there is some 
overlap between the two. <em>(For example a </em> <b><em>Swing JButton</em></b><em> component might be viewed as an 
improved functional replacement for an </em> <b><em>AWT Button</em></b><em> component, and once you 
begin using </em> <b><em>Swing</em></b><em> buttons you may choose to never again use an 
</em> <b><em>AWT</em></b><em> 
button.)</em> However, the basic functionality of <b>Swing</b> is built upon the functionality 
of the <b>AWT</b>. </p>
<p>Therefore, as a student, you cannot simply skip over an understanding of the <b>
AWT</b> and move on to <b>Swing</b>. The <b>AWT</b> is the foundation for
<b>Swing</b>. </p>
<p>You must first understand the <b>AWT</b> and then understand how <b>Swing</b> 
extends and improves on the <b>AWT</b>. I will attempt to integrate an 
understanding of both the <b>AWT</b> and <b>Swing</b> in the remaining chapters 
in this eBook. </p>
<p>I will begin by introducing you to a few simple components of each type and 
use these components to teach you about such topics as event-driven programming, 
layout, graphics, etc. Then, time permitting, I will dig a little deeper into 
the more complex aspects of both the <b>AWT</b> and <b>Swing </b>components and 
other features. </p>
