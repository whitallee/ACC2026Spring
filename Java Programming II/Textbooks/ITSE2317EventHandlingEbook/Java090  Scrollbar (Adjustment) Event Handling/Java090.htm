<p>Author's Note: An object of the <strong>JSlider</strong> class in Java 8 and 
later versions can be used for some 
<em>(but no all)</em> of the purposes for which 
a <strong>Scrollbar</strong> object may have been used in the early days of 
Java. Note also that a <strong>JSlider</strong> object is programmed in much the 
same way as the other components that you have seen discussed previously in this
<strong>eBook</strong>. That is not the case for the <strong>Scrollbar</strong>. 
Programming a <strong>Scrollbar</strong> is much more complicated. As a 
practical matter, until you have a need to write a program for a <strong>
Scrollbar</strong>, you might just want to skip this chapter.</p>

<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>JDK 1.1 was formally released on February 18, 1997. This chapter was 
originally written on February 21, 1997 using the software in JDK 1.1. It was 
upgraded to JDK 1.2 on 12/18/98. It was converted to CNXML with minor updates for publication on 
OpenStax on 07/11/16. It was partially revised for inclusion in this eBook in 
May, 2020.</p>
	
	<h1><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h1>
	
	<p>Event handling on a <strong>Scrollbar </strong>object differs from the 
	event handling in previous chapters in several respects. The 
	following paragraphs 
	contrast the <strong>Scrollbar </strong>with the <strong>Mouse</strong> in order to illustrate 
	some of the differences. </p>
<p>To create a listener object for the mouse, you either implement the <strong>
MouseListener </strong>interface, or you extend the <strong>MouseAdapter </strong>
class. </p>
<p>However, to create a listener object for a <strong>Scrollbar</strong>, you do 
not implement a <em>ScrollbarListener </em>interface or extend a <em>
ScrollbarAdapter </em>class, because they do not exist. </p>
<p>Instead, you implement the <strong>AdjustmentListener </strong>interface. The 
single method declared in the <strong>AdjustmentListener</strong> interface receives an
<strong>AdjustmentEvent</strong> object as a parameter. This is one of the <em>
semantic</em> events <em>(as opposed to low-level events) </em>similar to
<strong>ActionEvent</strong>, <strong>ItemEvent</strong>, and <strong>TextEvent.</strong>
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there is no <em>AdjustmentAdapter</em> class. It isn't needed 
because the <strong>AdjustmentListener </strong>interface declares only one 
method, which is shown below:</p>
	
<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
<pre>
public abstract void adjustmentValueChanged(AdjustmentEvent e) 
</pre>
</div>	

<p>The <strong>adjustmentValueChanged</strong> method is invoked when the 
value of the adjustable object <em>(the Scrollbar object in this chapter)</em> has changed.</p>
<p>Recall also that there are five different types of mouse events declared in 
the <strong>MouseListener </strong>interface: </p>
<ul>
	<li>mouseClicked,</li>
	<li>mouseEntered,</li>
	<li>mouseExited,</li>
	<li>mousePressed</li>
	<li>mouseReleased.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two additional types of 
mouse events that are declared in the <strong>MouseMotionListener </strong>
interface: </p>
<ul>
	<li>mouseDragged</li>
	<li>mouseMoved</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these different types of mouse events is represented by a method 
declaration in one or the other of the two interfaces defined for creating 
listener classes for mouse activity. You <em>override the method(s)</em> for 
those types of events which interest you. </p>
<p>There are five different types of adjustment events that correspond to the 
five ways of moving the bubble in a <strong>Scrollbar</strong> object. However, 
as mentioned above, there is only one method declared in the <strong>
AdjustmentListener</strong> interface. It is named <strong>
adjustmentValueChanged</strong>. It receives an object of type <strong>
AdjustmentEvent </strong>as a parameter when invoked. </p>
<p>The type of event is encoded into the object that is passed in as a parameter 
along with other information such as the <em>value</em><strong> </strong>of the <strong>
Scrollbar </strong>and the <em>name</em><strong> </strong>of the <strong>Scrollbar
</strong>object. The <em>value</em> of the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> is 
determined by the position of the bubble on the <strong>Scrollbar</strong>. </p>
<p>The <strong>AdjustmentEvent </strong>class defines several methods that can 
be used to extract information from the object in case you need access to that 
information. This is discussed in more detail later. </p>
<p>The types of adjustment events <em>(corresponding to physical methods of moving 
the bubble on the </em> <strong><em>Scrollbar</em></strong>) are defined as static variables in 
the <strong>AdjustmentEvent</strong> class. The five different types of adjustment events and 
their relationship to moving the bubble are: </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>UNIT_INCREMENT</strong> - click button on one end of the Scrollbar
	</li>
	<li><strong>UNIT_DECREMENT</strong> - click button on the other end of the Scrollbar
	</li>
	<li><strong>BLOCK_INCREMENT</strong> - click in space between bubble and one button
	</li>
	<li><strong>BLOCK_DECREMENT</strong> - click in space between bubble and other button
	</li>
	<li><strong>TRACK</strong> - drag the bubble </li>
</ul>
<p>As indicated, the two <em>UNIT</em> types are generated by clicking on the buttons at 
either end of the Scrollbar. </p>
<p>The two <em>BLOCK</em> types are generated by clicking interior to the 
<strong>Scrollbar</strong> on 
either side of the bubble. </p>
<p>The <em>TRACK</em> event is generated by dragging the bubble. </p>
<p>Methods are available for setting various parameters of the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> 
including the range, the width of the bubble <em>(alternately referred to in the 
documentation as page size or visible</em>), the size of the unit 
and block increments or decrements, etc. </p>
<p>One might surmise that this rather general purpose adjustment 
approach was defined to support a family of components that operate on an 
adjustment basis. However, a quick search of the index in the JDK 1.1.3 
documentation package did not identify any other components that use the 
adjustment interface. Perhaps other adjustable objects are planned for future 
versions of the AWT. 
<em>(Note that as of Java 8, the <strong>AdjustmentListener </strong>interface is also implemented by the <strong>AWTEventMulticaster</strong> class. 
However, that class is not discussed in this chapter.)</em></p>

<h1><a name="The_sample_program">The sample program</a></h1>

<p>This section presents a discussion of the program followed by the program 
listing. </p>
<h2><a name="Discussion">Discussion</a></h2>
<p>This program places a <strong>Scrollbar </strong>object and a <strong>
TextField </strong>object in a <strong>Frame</strong> object as shown in 
<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Figure_1">Figure 1.</a> Graphic screen output for Event18.
</p>
<p><img alt="A Scrollbar object and a TextField object in a Frame object" height="76" src="event18a.jpg" width="301"/></p>
</div>

<p>Whenever the <em>bubble
</em>in the <strong>Scrollbar </strong>is moved using any of the five available 
physical methods for moving the bubble, the <em>value</em> of the
<strong>Scrollbar</strong> <em>(which normally should represent the position of the 
center of the bubble</em>) is extracted from the event object and displayed 
in the TextField object. <em>(Certain arithmetic corrections are required to cause 
the value to represent the center of the bubble because the actual value 
returned represents the left-hand edge of the bubble for a horizontal </em> <strong>
<em>Scrollbar</em></strong><em>.) </em> </p>
<p>Also, whenever the bubble is moved, several other pieces of information are 
extracted from the object and displayed on the command-line screen. This includes the 
identification of the adjustable object and the type of adjustable event. </p>
<p>Note also that although five different initialization parameters are included 
as parameters to the <strong>Scrollbar </strong>constructor, other important 
initialization parameters such as <strong>BlockIncrement</strong> and <strong>
UnitIncrement</strong> are not included in the parameter list. They must be set 
following instantiation using methods such as <strong>setBlockIncrement</strong>.
</p>
<p>Experimentation indicates that the default value for <strong>BlockIncrement</strong> 
is ten units and the default value for <strong>UnitIncrement</strong> is one 
unit. </p>
<p>Reiterating what was mentioned earlier, the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> listener object is not 
added as a <em>ScrollbarListener </em>but rather is defined by implementing the
<strong>AdjustmentListener </strong>interface and then added as an <strong>
AdjustmentListener</strong>. </p>
<p>The <strong>AdjustmentListener</strong> interface declares only one method 
that may be overridden: <strong>adjustmentValueChanged</strong>. </p>
<p>This method receives an object of type <strong>AdjustmentEvent</strong> that
<em>(as of Java 8)</em> 
provides five methods that can be used to obtain information about the event.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>getAdjustable</strong> method of the <strong>
	AdjustmentEvent</strong> class returns information containing the 
	identification of the object that generated the event.</li>
	<li>The <strong>getAdjustmentType</strong> method returns information 
	containing the identification of the type of event (click the buttons on the 
	Scrollbar, drag the bubble, etc.).</li>
	<li>The <strong>paramString</strong> method contains a variety of 
	information which overlaps the two above methods to some extent.</li>
	<li>The <strong>getValue</strong> method returns the value produced by the 
	adjustment.</li>
	<li>The <strong>getValueIsAdjusting</strong> method returns true if this is 
	one of multiple adjustment events. <em>(This method was not defined in the 
	class when this chapter was originally written in 1997.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Three of these five methods are used in the following program. The <strong>
paramString</strong> and <strong>getValueIsAdjusting</strong> methods are not used. </p>
<p>There are many important comments in the program that 
add to this discussion, particularly with respect to bugs in the <strong>
Scrollbar</strong> component, and arithmetic adjustments required to compensate 
for the width of the bubble. <em>(Note, however, that the comments related to 
bugs may no longer apply in Java 8 and beyond.)</em></p>
<h2><a name="Interesting_code_fragments">Interesting code fragments</a></h2>
<p>I will discuss and explain this program in fragments. A complete listing is 
provided in <a href="#Listing_9">Listing 9</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> shows the controlling class that contains the requisite <strong>main</strong> method. The <strong>main</strong> method 
instantiates an object of type <strong>GUI</strong> where all of the work is 
done.</p>


<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_1">Listing 1.</a> The controlling class for Event18.java.
</p>

</pre>
</div>

with some instance variables used later in the program.</p>

</p>
<pre>
class GUI{
  Scrollbar myScrollbar;
  TextField displayWindow;
  int bubbleWidth;//needs to be accessible by event handler
</pre>
</div>
<p><a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> shows the beginning of the constructor for the <strong>GUI</strong> 
class. The constructor begins by instantiating a <strong>Frame</strong> object 
to serve as a top-level window for the application.</p>




<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_3">Listing 3.</a> Beginning of the constructor for the GUI 
class.
</p>
<pre>
  GUI(){
    Frame myFrame = new Frame("Copyright, R.G.Baldwin");

    bubbleWidth = 20;
    int initialPosition = 50 - bubbleWidth/2;
    int min = 0 - bubbleWidth/2;
    int max = 100 + bubbleWidth/2;
    myScrollbar = new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL, 
                     initialPosition, bubbleWidth, min, max);
</pre>
</div>
<p>This is followed by instantiation of a horizontal <strong>Scrollbar</strong> 
object with a range from 0 to 100, an initial position at 50, a bubble width <em>(page 
size) </em>of 20, a unit increment of 2 <em>(see <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a>)</em>, and a block increment of 15
<em>(see Listing 4)</em>. </p>
<p>The <strong>Scrollbar</strong> component does not center the bubble on the value. 
Rather, the left edge of the bubble is lined up with the value. The result is 
that values in the upper end of the range cannot be reached unless appropriate 
adjustments are made using half the bubble width. This distributes the 
unreachable values at each end of the Scrollbar. You can then set the <em>min</em> and 
<em>max</em> values to extend beyond the desired values by one-half the bubble width.</p>
<p><a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> sets the unit increment to 2 and the block increment to 15. 
The unit increment is the amount of change resulting from clicking a button on 
the end of the <strong>Scrollbar</strong>. The block increment is the amount of change resulting 
from clicking between the bubble and the button on the end.</p>




<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_4">Listing 4.</a> Set the unit and block increments.
</p>
<pre>
    myScrollbar.setBlockIncrement(15);
    myScrollbar.setUnitIncrement(2);
</pre>
</div>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> should be very 
familiar to you by now. It really isn't very interesting at this point, and is 
included in this section solely for completeness.</p>

    myFrame.setSize(300,75);
    myFrame.setVisible(true);

    //Instantiate a listener object for the Scrollbar and 
    // register it to receive notification of adjustment 
    // events.    
    MyScrollbarListener myScrollbarListener = 
      new MyScrollbarListener(this);    
    //Note that the Scrollbar listener is not added as a 
    // ScrollbarListener but rather is added as an 
    // AdjustmentListener.
    myScrollbar.addAdjustmentListener(myScrollbarListener);

    //Close Frame to terminate.    
    myFrame.addWindowListener(new MyWindowListener());
  }//end constructor
}//end class GUI
</pre>
</div>
<p>This fragment creates the display window using a <strong>
TextField</strong> object. It also adds the two components to the <strong>Frame</strong>, 
sets the size of the <strong>Frame</strong>, and makes the whole thing visible.</p>
<p>The fragment also includes typical code to instantiate a 
listener object for the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> and register it to receive 
notification of adjustment events.</p>
<p>This is followed by typical code to register a window listener 
to terminate the program when the user clicks the close box on the <strong>Frame</strong>.</p>
<p>That ends the constructor and also ends the definition of the
<strong>GUI</strong> class. </p>
<p>The code in <a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> shows the beginning of 
the <strong>AdjustmentListener</strong> class from which a listener object is 
instantiated and registered on the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> to listen for 
adjustment events. This fragment shows the constructor for the class that saves 
a reference to the <strong>Scrollbar</strong>.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> shows the beginning of the <strong>adjustmentValueChanged</strong> method, 
which is the only method declared by the <strong>AdjustmentListener</strong> 
interface. This method receives a parameter which is an object of type <strong>

/*File Event18.java Copyright, R.G.Baldwin

Revised 12/18/97
This program was designed to be compiled and executed under
JDK 1.1.3 or later version.

In an earlier version of this program compiled under 
JDK 1.1, in February 1997, I reported numerous bugs in the
JDK Scrollbar handling.  I have now recompiled the program 
and can report that most of the bugs seem to have been fixed,
although a couple of bugs still seem to exist.

One remaining bug is that if you adjust the scrollbar by
dragging the bubble into an area which would report negative
values, large positive values are reported instead of small
negative values (i.e.: something like 65536 instead of -1).
This does not happen if the scrollbar is adjusted by 
clicking on the end buttons or in the area between the
bubble and the buttons.  A numeric workaround was
implemented in this program to work around that bug. Note
that the bug still exists in JDK 1.1.6 but was fixed in the
first release of JDK 1.2.

Another possible bug is that the scrollbar seems to be able
to report a value that is one unitIncrement too large for 
the specified maximum value and bubble width.  Note
that the bug still exists in JDK 1.1.6 but was fixed in the
first release of JDK 1.2.

This program places a Scrollbar object and a TextField 
object in a Frame.  Whenever the bubble in the Scrollbar is
moved using any of the five available methods for moving 
the bubble the value of the Scrollbar (which should 
represent the position of the bubble) is displayed in the
TextField object.

Also, whenever the bubble is moved, several other pieces of
information are displayed on the screen which identify
various parameters of the adjustment.

Closing the frame terminates the program.

<h1><a name="Review">Review</a></h1>
<p>Q - All of the <strong>Scrollbar </strong>bugs were eliminated in JDK 1.1.3: 
True or False? If false, explain why. </p>
<p>A - False. JDK 1.1.3 appears to still have at least two Scrollbar bugs. One 
bug causes the <em>track</em> event <em>(which involves dragging the bubble in the 
Scrollbar object) </em>to return large positive values such as 65535 when it should 
be returning small negative values such as -1. The other apparent bug allows the 
different versions of the event to return a value larger than would be 
calculated using the minimum and maximum values along with the width of the 
bubble. </p>
<p>Q - The <strong>Scrollbar </strong>bugs listed above cause the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> 
component to be completely unusable: True or False? If false, explain why. </p>
<p>A - False. While these two bugs represent a significant inconvenience, it is 
probably possible to work around both of them by making numeric corrections. </p>
<p>Q - To create a listener object for a <strong>Scrollbar</strong>, you must 
implement the <em>ScrollbarListener </em>interface or extend a <em>
ScrollbarAdapter</em> class: True or False? If false, explain why. </p>
<p>A - False. To create a listener object for a <strong>Scrollbar</strong>, you 
do not implement a <em>ScrollbarListener </em>interface or extend a <em>
ScrollbarAdapter </em>class, because they do not exist. Instead, you implement 
an <strong>AdjustmentListener </strong>interface. </p>
<p>Q - To create a listener object for a <strong>Scrollbar</strong>, you can 
either implement the <em>AdjustmentListener</em> interface or extend the <em>
AdjustmentAdapter</em> class: True or False? If False, explain why. </p>
<p>A - False. There is no <em>AdjustmentAdapter</em> class. It isn't needed 
because the <strong>AdjustmentListener </strong>interface declares only one 
method with the following signature: </p>
	
<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
<pre>
public abstract void adjustmentValueChanged(AdjustmentEvent e) 
</pre>
</div>	

<p>Q - The <strong>adjustmentValueChanged</strong> method is invoked when the 
value of the <strong>Scrollbar </strong>object is changed: True or False? If 
false, explain why. </p>
<p>A - True. </p>
<p>Q - There are five different types of adjustment events that correspond to 
the different methods of moving the bubble in a <strong>Scrollbar</strong> 
object: True or False. If false, explain why. </p>
<p>A - True. </p>
<p>Q - As with most of the other classes in the AWT, the <em>AdjustmentListener</em> 
interface declares a separate method for each type of adjustment event. Each of 
these methods must be implemented in any class that implements the <em>
AdjustmentListener</em> interface: True or False? If false, explain why. </p>
<p>A - False. Only one method is declared in the <em>AdjustmentListener</em> 
interface. The name of the method is <strong>adjustmentValueChanged</strong>.
</p>
<p>Q - The <strong>adjustmentValueChanged</strong> method receives an object 
of type <strong>AdjustmentEvent</strong> as a parameter, and the type of event 
is encoded into the object: True or False? If false, explain why. </p>
<p>A - True. </p>
<p>Q - In addition to the type of the event, additional information is also 
encoded into the object that is passed to the <strong>adjustmentValueChanged</strong> 
method. Give examples of two other kinds of information encoded into the 
object.. </p>
<p>A - Information such as the <em>value</em><strong> </strong>of the <strong>Scrollbar
</strong>and the <em>name</em><strong> </strong>of the <strong>Scrollbar </strong>
component is also encoded into the object. </p>
<p>Q - The types of adjustment events are defined as static variables in the 
<strong>AdjustmentEvent</strong> class. What are the names of these variables, and how 
do they 
correspond to user actions on the <strong>Scrollbar </strong>object? </p>
<p>A - The names of the <strong>static</strong> variables and their relationship 
to the <strong>Scrollbar </strong>object are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>UNIT_INCREMENT - click button on one end of the Scrollbar</li>
	<li>UNIT_DECREMENT - click button on the other end of the Scrollbar</li>
	<li>BLOCK_INCREMENT - click in space between bubble and one button</li>
	<li>BLOCK_DECREMENT - click in space between bubble and other button</li>
	<li>TRACK - drag the bubble</li>
</ul>
<p>Q - The width of the bubble is also referred to by at least two other terms 
in the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> documentation. What are they? </p>
<p>A - The other terms used to describe the bubble width are <em>page size</em> 
and <em>visible</em>. These terms seem to be related to the use of a <strong>
Scrollbar</strong> on the side or bottom of a window of text where the size of 
the bubble is indicative of the amount of text that is visible in the window in 
relation to the amount of text in the entire document.. </p>
<p>Q - In JDK 1.1.3, the <em>value</em><strong> </strong>of the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> 
object is represented by the center of the bubble: True or False? If false, 
explain why. </p>
<p>A - False. The <em>value</em><strong> </strong>of the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> 
object is represented by an edge of the bubble. For example, the <em>value</em> 
is represented by the position of the left edge of the bubble for a horizontal
<strong>Scrollbar</strong>. If you want the position of the center of the bubble 
to represent a <em>value</em>, you must perform a numeric correction <em>(involving 
half the width of the bubble)</em> on the <em>value</em> of the <strong>
Scrollbar </strong>actually extracted from the event object. </p>
<p>Q - All necessary initialization parameters for a <strong>Scrollbar</strong> 
object are provided as parameters to one of the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> 
constructors: True or False: If false, explain why. </p>
<p>A - False. Although five different initialization parameters are included as 
parameters to the <strong>Scrollbar </strong>constructor, other important 
initialization parameters such as <strong>BlockIncrement</strong> and <strong>
UnitIncrement</strong> are not included in the parameter list. They must be set 
following instantiation using methods such as <strong>setBlockIncrement</strong>.
</p>
<p>Q - The <strong>AdjustmentEvent</strong> class provides five methods that can 
be used to obtain information about the event. What are they and what kinds of 
information do they return? </p>
<p>A - The five methods and the information that they return are listed below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>getAdjustable</strong> method returns the identification 
	of the object that generated the event.</li>
	<li>The <strong>getAdjustmentType</strong> method returns the 
	identification of the type of event.</li>
	<li>The <strong>paramString</strong> method returns a variety of 
	information which overlaps the two above methods to some extent.</li>
	<li>The <strong>getValue</strong> method returns the <strong>value
	</strong>produced by the adjustment.</li>
	<li>The <strong>getValueIsAdjusting</strong> method returns true if this is one of multiple adjustment events. 
	<em>(This method was not defined in the class when this chapter was originally written in 1997.)</em></li>
</ul>

Without viewing the following solution, write a Java
application that meets the specifications given below.

To accommodate this program, you will need to be using
JDK 1.1.3 or a later version.

Write an application that places a vertical Scrollbar and a
Label on a Frame.  The Label is used to display the 
position of the center of the bubble in the Scrollbar.

The Scrollbar values should range from approximately -50
to +50 (exact end points are difficult to achieve).

The width of the bubble should be 10 units.

When you click on the buttons at the end of the Scrollbar,
the bubble should move by 3 units.

When you click in the area between the bubble and the
buttons, the bubble should move by 6 units.

When the program starts, the bubble should be centered
and the Label should indicate a bubble position of 0.

Closing the frame terminates the program.

End of specifications.
