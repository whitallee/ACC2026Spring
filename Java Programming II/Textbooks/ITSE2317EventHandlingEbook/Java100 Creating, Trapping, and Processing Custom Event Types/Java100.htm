</FONT><P>Students in Prof. Baldwin's <B><U>Intermediate Java Programming</B></U> classes at ACC are responsible for knowing and understanding all of the material in this chapter. </P>
<P>JDK 1.1 was formally released on February 18, 1997. This chapter was originally written on March 27, 1997 using the software and documentation in the JDK 1.1 download package. </P>
<P>On 2/24/99, it was confirmed that the sample program in this chapter works properly with JDK 1.2 under Win95.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>
</FONT><P>The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate one way that you can create your own custom event types. In other words, if you need a type of event that is not one of the standard types, it is possible for you to create a new type. Then you can cause events of that new type to be generated, trapped, and processed. </P>
<P>This is an important aspect of Java Beans technology, so it is worth learning how to do it while we are studying the various ways of working with events. We will be referring back to this material in a future chapter on Java Beans. </P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="essential_ingredients_for_creating_custo"></A>Essential Ingredients for Creating Custom Event Types</H2>
</FONT><P>Using the techniques illustrated in this program, the essential ingredients for creating, trapping, and processing a new custom event type are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Define a class from which objects of the new custom event type can be instantiated. It should extend <B>EventObject</B>. </LI>
<LI>Define an <B>EventListener </B>interface for the new custom event type. This interface should be <I>implemented </I>by <B>Listener </B>classes for the new type. The interface should extend <B>EventListener</B>. </LI>
<LI>Define a <B>Listener </B>class that <I>implements </I>the interface for the new custom event type. </LI>
<LI>Define a class for instantiating objects capable of generating the new custom event type. In this program, that class extends <B>Component</B> and is in the category of "program-generated events." </LI>
<LI>Define a method, preferably named <B>add&lt;CustomEventNameListener</B>, that can maintain a list of <B>Listener </B>objects registered to listen for events of the new custom type (In this bare-bones program, to avoid complexity, the length of the list is limited to only one <B>Listener </B>object. See discussion in the next section.) </LI>
<LI>Define a method that dispatches an event object of the new custom event type to all <B>Listener </B>objects registered in the above list by invoking the central event-trapping method of those <B>Listener </B>objects. This event-trapping method is the method declared in the <B>EventListener </B>interface for the new custom event type. In this program, it is named <B>customEventTrapped()</B>.</LI></UL>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="discussion_of_multiple_listener_objects"></A>Discussion of Multiple Listener Objects</H2>
</FONT><P>The <I>delegation event model</I> can support the registration of multiple <B>Listener</B> objects on a single event-generating source object. The model can also support the registration of objects from a single <B>Listener</B> class on multiple event-generating source objects. Finally, the model can support various combinations of the two. </P>
<P>In an earlier chapter on "program-generated events", we learned how to use the <B>add()</B> method of the <B>AWTEventMulticaster</B> class to create and maintain a list of registered <B>Listener</B> objects. This method supports the capability to register multiple <B>Listener</B> objects on a single event-generating source object. When you then invoke an event dispatching method (such as <B>actionPerformed()</B>) on the reference to the list, the event is automatically dispatched to every <B>Listener</B> object in the list. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the <B>add()</B> method of the <B>AWTEventMulticaster</B> class cannot be used directly to maintain a list of registered <B>Listener</B> objects for new custom event types because there is no overloaded version of the <B>add()</B> method whose signature matches the new event type. </P>
<P>One way to create and maintain such a list of registered <B>Listener</B> objects is to embark on a <I>data structures</I> programming exercise in <I>list processing</I>. Since <I>data structures</I> is not the thrust of this chapter, I decided not to take that approach. If you would like to see some example code showing how to create and maintain your own list of registered objects in a situation similar to this, see Chapter 15 of <U>Inside Java</U> by Siyan and Weaver, ISBN 1-56205-664-6, $55.00 USA/$77.95 CAN. </P>
<P>Another approach that would probably work would be to subclass the <B>AWTEventMulticaster</B> class and overload the <B>add()</B> method. The method would have a signature that matches the new type of event Of course, the body of the overloaded method would still have to provide the list-processing code so this could become a little complicated.. If I can find the time, I may try to do that and update this chapter later. </P>
<P>In the meantime, the primary thrust of this chapter on custom event types can be adequately illustrated by limiting the number of <B>Listener</B> objects to one object per object-registration list. Also, that limitation will probably satisfy a reasonable percentage of real-world situations. Therefore, I decided to avoid the complexity of <I>list-processing</I> code in the sample program in this chapter by limiting the number of <B>Listener</B> objects to one <B>Listener</B> object per object-registration list.. </P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="sample_program"></A>Sample Program</H2>
</FONT><P>This program is designed to be compiled and run under JDK 1.1. </P>
<P>This is a bare-bones program that illustrates the ability to <U>create, trap, and process</U> events of new custom types. </P>
<P>The program also illustrates program-generated events, a capability that was also illustrated in an earlier sample program in a previous chapter. You should make certain that you understand that material before embarking on this chapter. </P>
<P>A non-visual object class (named <B>NonVisual</B>) is defined. Objects of this class are capable of generating events of the new custom event type. </P>
<P>The essential ingredients for creating, trapping, and processing events of new custom types were listed in an earlier section of this chapter. </P>
<P>In this program, two objects of the <B>NonVisual </B>class are instantiated and one <B>CustomEventListenerClass </B>class is defined. The <B>CustomEventListenerClass</B> class <I>implements</I> the <B>CustomEventListener</B> interface and defines a method for processing <B>CustomEvent</B> objects named <B>customEventTrapped()</B>. </P>
<P>Objects of the <B>CustomEventListenerClass</B> class are instantiated and registered to listen for custom events on both of the <B>NonVisual </B>objects mentioned above. Therefore, this program also illustrates the capability to instantiate and register <B>Listener</B> objects from a single <B>Listener</B> class on multiple event-generating source objects. </P>
<P>The <B>NonVisual</B> object contains an instance method named <B>generateCustomEvent()</B> This method is designed to dispatch an event of the new custom event type to the <B>Listener</B> object registered on the source object by invoking the <B>customEventTrapped()</B> method of the <B>Listener</B> object. </P>
<P>In the program, the <B>generateCustomEvent()</B> method is invoked on both of the <B>NonVisual </B>objects causing custom events to occur and to be trapped and processed by the registered <B>CustomEventListenerClass </B>objects. </P>
<P>The processing of the event in this case is fairly simple. Identification and source information is extracted from the <B>CustomEvent</B> object that is passed as a parameter to the <B>customEventTrapped()</B> method. That information is displayed on the standard output device. </P>
<P>The output from the program for one particular run was: </P>
<B><PRE>Copyright, R.G.Baldwin
customEventTrapped() method invoked on First NonVisualObject
Source of event was NonVisual[,0,0,0x0,invalid]
customEventTrapped() method invoked on Second NonVisualObject

<P ALIGN="CENTER">As you can see, this class extends <B>java.util.EventObject</B>. The constructor for an object of this class receives two parameters. The first parameter is a reference to the object that generated the event. This parameter is passed to the constructor of the superclass, <B>EventObject</B>, where it is stored for later access using the <B>getSource()</B> method of class <B>EventObject.</B> </P>
<P>The second parameter is <B>String </B>identification information provided to the constructor when the <B>CustomEvent</B> object is instantiated. In this program, the <B>String </B>information is simply a <B>String </B>object stored as an instance variable in the source object when it was instantiated. You could pass virtually any identifying or command information in this manner. The <B>String </B>information is stored as an instance variable in the <B>CustomEvent</B> object. </P>
<P>The class also provides an accessor method that returns the <B>String</B> stored as an instance variable in the object. </P>
<P>The next interesting code fragment is the definition of a new <B>Listener</B> interface named <B>CustomEventListener</B> that extends <B>EventListener</B>. This interface declares a method named <B>customEventTrapped()</B> which is the primary event processing method of <B>Listener</B> objects of this class. It is through this method that events are dispatched to the listener objects. <br/>

<P>The next interesting code fragment implements the above interface and defines a <B>Listener</B> class for events of this new custom type. It is a <I>plain-vanilla </I><B>Listener </B>class that overrides the <B>customEventTrapped()</B> method declared in the interface.

<P>We start with the beginning of the class definition that shows that this class extends <B>Component</B> and maintains two instance variables. One of the instance variables is the <B>String</B> <B>ID</B> information initialized by the constructor. The other instance variable is a reference to the <B>Listener</B> object registered on the source object. The constructor code is too simple to merit display in this section. <br/>

<P>The next interesting code fragment is the code that actually registers a <B>Listener</B> object. This is very similar to the code in the previous chapter except that this code doesn't use the <B>AWTEventMulticaster.add()</B> method to create and maintain a list of registered <B>Listener</B> objects.

This program is designed to be compiled and run under JDK 1.1

This is a bare-bones program that illustrates the ability to create, trap,
and process events of new custom types.  

The program also illustrates program-generated events, but this capability 
was also illustrated in an earlier sample program.  It would be good to 
understand that material before tackling this lesson.

A non-visual object class (named NonVisual) is defined.  Objects of 
this class are capable of generating Custom events.  

The essential ingredients for creating, trapping, and processing events of
new custom types, as used in this example program are:
1.  Define a class from which objects of the new custom event type can 
be instantiated.  It should extend EventObject.
2.  Define an EventListener interface for the new custom event type to be 
implemented by Listener classes. It should extend EventListener.
3.  Define a Listener class that implements the interface for the new 
custom event type.
4.  Define a class for instantiating objects capable of generating the 
new custom event type. In this program, that class extends Component.
5.  Define a method, preferably named add<CustomEvent>Listener, that can 
maintain a list of Listener objects registered to listen for events of the 
new custom type on another object (In this bare-bones program, to avoid
complexity, the length of the list is limited to only one Listener object.)
6.  Define a method that dispatches an event object of the new custom 
event type to all Listener objects registered in the above list by 
invoking the central event-trapping method of those Listener objects.  
This event-trapping method is the method declared in the EventListener
interface for the new custom event type.  In this program, it is named
customEventTrapped().

In this program, two objects of the NonVisual class are instantiated.

One CustomEventListener class is defined.  An object of this class is 
instantiated and registered to listen for Custom events on both of the 
NonVisual objects mentioned above.

The generateCustomEvent() method is invoked on each the NonVisual objects 
causing Custom events to occur and to be trapped and processed by the 
CustomEventListener objects.  

The output from the program for one particular run was:

Copyright, R.G.Baldwin
customEventTrapped() method invoked on First NonVisualObject
Source of event was NonVisual[,0,0,0x0,invalid]
customEventTrapped() method invoked on Second NonVisualObject
Source of event was NonVisual[,0,0,0x0,invalid]

The program was tested using JDK 1.1 running under Win95.
