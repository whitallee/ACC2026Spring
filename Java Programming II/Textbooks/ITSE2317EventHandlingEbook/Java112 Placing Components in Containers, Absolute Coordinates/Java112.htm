Students in Prof. Baldwin's <b><u>Intermediate Java Programming</u></b>
classes at ACC are responsible for knowing and understanding all of the
material in this chapter.

<p>JDK 1.1 was formally released on February 18, 1997. This chapter was
originally written on March 5, 1997 using the software and documentation
in the JDK 1.1 download package. The chapter has been updated several times
since it was originally written.
<center><h2><a name="introduction"></a><font color="#ff0000">Introduction</font></h2></center>
This is one in a series of chapters that concentrates on the package <b>java.awt
</b>which contains most of the functionality for providing the user interface
to your Java application or applet.

<p>We can place components in containers using absolute position and size
coordinates, or we can use any of several different layout managers to
do the job.

<p>Using layout managers is considered by many to be the safer approach
because this approach is designed to automatically compensate for differences
in screen resolution and component size/shape between platforms.

<p>The different layout managers are defined in classes having the following
names:
<ul><li><b>BorderLayout</b></li>

<li><b>CardLayout</b></li>

<li><b>FlowLayout</b></li>

<li><b>GridLayout</b></li>

<li><b>GridBagLayout</b></li></ul>
In addition to the layout manager classes, there is a class named <b>GridBagConstraints</b>
that is used to work with the <b>GridBagLayout</b> class as well as a class
named <b>Insets</b> that is used to work with other layout manager classes.

<p>In addition to using the standard layout manager classes, we can <u>create
our own</u> custom layout manager.

<p>This chapter will discuss the placement of components into a container
using <u>absolute coordinates</u>. Subsequent chapters will discuss the
other possibilities listed above.
<center><h2><a name="absolute positioning and size"></a><font color="#ff0000">Absolute
Positioning and Size</font></h2></center>
The <b>Component </b>class of JDK 1.1 provides the methods <b>setBounds(int,int,int,int)</b>
and <b>setBounds(Rectangle)</b> that allow you to specify the location
and size of a component in absolute coordinates measured in pixels.

<p>A description of these two methods, as extracted from the JDK 1.1.3
documentation follows:
<br/>
<div class="a"><pre>public void setBounds(int x,
 int y,
 int width,
 int height)</pre>

<dl><dd>
Moves and resizes this component. The new location of the top-left</dd>

<br/>corner is specified by <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, and the new size
is specified
<br/>by <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt>.
<dl><dt><b>Parameters:</b></dt>

<dd><tt>x</tt> - The new <i>x-coordinate</i> of this component.</dd>

<dd><tt>y</tt> - The new <i>y-coordinate</i> of this component.</dd>

<dd><tt>width</tt> - The new <tt>width</tt> of this component.</dd>

<br/><tt>height</tt> - The new <tt>height</tt> of this component.</dl></dl></div>
.
<br/>
<div class="a"><pre>public void setBounds(Rectangle r)</pre>

<dl><dd>
Moves and resizes this component to conform to the new bounding</dd>

<br/>rectangle <tt>r</tt>. This component's new position is specified
<br/>by <tt>r.x</tt> and <tt>r.y</tt>, and its new size is specified by
<tt>r.width</tt> and <tt>r.height</tt>
<dl><dt><b>Parameters:</b></dt>

<br/><tt>r - The new bounding rectangle for this component.</tt></dl></dl></div>
As you can see from the above, the location and size of the component are
specified by the location and size of a bounding rectangle that can in
turn be specified by four integer parameters, or can be specified as an
object of class <b>Rectangle</b>..

<p>Many authors will tell you that specifying the location and size of
your components in absolute coordinates will make it more difficult to
achieve satisfactory results on a variety of platforms and displays. Regardless
of that, you probably need to know how to do it, and that is the subject
of this chapter.

<p>The following sample program illustrates the positioning and sizing
of components on an absolute coordinate basis in JDK 1.1. Note that this
program uses several new methods that did not exist in JDK 1.0.
<center><h3><a name="sample program"></a><font color="#ff0000">Sample Program</font></h3></center>
The following application, named <b>Layout01.java</b> places a <b>Button
</b>object and a <b>Label </b>object in a <b>Frame </b>object using absolute
coordinates in pixels. The program is designed for simplicity and therefore
does not contain any event handlers. With no event handlers, the <i>Close</i>
button on the Frame object is <u>not operationa</u>l, so you will have
to terminate the program using some other method.
<center><h4><a name="discussion"></a><font color="#ff0000">Discussion</font></h4></center>
The program shows how to use the new methods in JDK 1.1 to set the size
and position of components in a <b>Frame </b>object using absolute coordinates.

<p>The program also illustrates some of the potential <u>problems</u> associated
with the use of absolute coordinates.

<p>A <b>Button</b> and a yellow <b>Label</b> are placed in a <b>Frame</b>
object. Note that the specified location and size of the components may
cause the two objects to <u>overlap</u>. This is one of the potential problems
with the use of absolute coordinates. Note also that the initial height
of the <b>Frame </b>object may <u>clip</u> off the bottom of the <b>Label</b>.
Of course, problems of this sort could be avoided, on one platform at least,
by careful design.

<p>If the <b>Frame</b> is resized by the user, the <b>Button </b>and the
<b>Label </b>remain <u>fixed in size and position</u>. The <b>Frame </b>can
be resized to the point where the two components are <u>no longer visible</u>.
Hopefully, a user would know not to do that.

<p>Also, the <u>specified size</u> of the <b>Label </b>may <u>not be sufficient</u>
to display the entire initial text string placed in the label. Again, this
could be avoided, on one platform, through more careful design. Getting
it right on one platform, however, doesn't guarantee that it will be right
on other platforms as well.

<p>The program was tested using JDK 1.1 running under Win95.
<center><h4><a name="interesting code fragments"></a><font color="#ff0000">Interesting
Code Fragments</font></h4></center>
The following code fragments from the program are particularly interesting.
<h4><font color="#ff0000">Create and Size the Button Object</font></h4>
The following two statements
<br/>
<div class="a"><pre> Button myButton = new Button("Button");
 myButton.setBounds(new<b> Rectangle(25,50,100,75))</b>;</pre></div>
result in the following actions.
<ul><li>
Create a <b>Button </b>object with the caption "Button"</li>

<li>
Specify that the button is to be located at x = 25 and y = 50, measured
in pixels from the upper left-hand corner of the containing object. Positive
y is measured going <u>down</u> the screen. The reference point on the
button is the upper left-hand corner of the button.</li>

<li>
Specify that the button is to be 100 pixels wide and 75 pixels high</li></ul>
Note that at the point in the program where these two statements are executed,
the containing object hasn't yet been identified. Thus, <b>setBounds()</b>
provides absolute coordinate information for whatever container the <b>Button</b>
is <u>eventually placed in</u>.

<p>The <b>setBounds()</b> method is a method of the <b>Component</b> class
that is <u>inherited by all subclasses</u> of <b>Component </b>including
<b>Button</b>.

<p>The method specifies that the component is to be located and sized according
to a bounding rectangle whose sides are parallel to the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>
axes.

<p>As shown earlier, there are two overloaded versions of <b>setBounds()</b>.
One version allows the location and size of the box to specified directly
as four integer parameters (x, y, width, height).

<p>The other version, which is the version used above, requires the location
and size of the box to be specified by an object of type <b>Rectangle</b>
that is passed as a parameter to the method. This is the most flexible
approach because the <b>Rectangle</b> class has about seven different constructors
that can be used to create the bounding box.
<h4><font color="#ff0000">Create and Size the Label Object</font></h4>
The next interesting code fragment creates a <b>Label </b>component with
a yellow background, again using the <b>setBounds()</b> method to specify
its location and size. This code places the upper left-hand corner of the
<b>Label</b> object at a coordinate position of 100 by 100 pixels, and
causes its width to be 100 pixels and its height to be 75 pixels.
<br/>
<div class="a"><pre> Label myLabel = new Label(
 "Copyright, R.G.Baldwin");
 myLabel.setBounds(new<b> Rectangle(100,100,100,75))</b>;
 myLabel.setBackground(Color.yellow);</pre></div>
The <b>setBackground(Color c)</b> method is also a method of the <b>Component</b>
class that is inherited by subclasses of <b>Component</b>. This method
requires an object of the <b>Color </b>class as a parameter. There are
many different ways to create the <b>Color</b> object, the simplest of
which is simply to refer to one of the <i>class constants </i>that are
defined in the <b>Color</b> class using syntax such as
<br/>
<div class="a"><pre><b><tt>public final static Color yellow</tt></b></pre></div>
Recall that variables declared as <b>static</b> in a class can be accessed
using the name of the class and the name of the variable. Making the variable
<b>final</b> causes it to be a constant.

<p>About thirteen different colors can be specified in this way. If you
need a color not included in this list, you can use one of the overloaded
constructors to specify your color using specified contributions of red,
green, and blue. The <b>Color</b> class provides many different methods
for dealing with colors.
<h4><font color="#ff0000">Create the Frame Object</font></h4>
The next interesting code fragment creates a <b>Frame</b> object with the
title "Copyright, R.G.Baldwin" <b>Frame</b> is the type of object
that users of the <i>Windows </i>operating system would probably consider
to be a typical "Window". It is <i>resizable</i>, has a <i>minimize </i>button,
a <i>maximize </i>button, a <i>control box</i> button, and a <i>close </i>button.

<p>The default layout for a frame is <b>BorderLayout</b> which we will
be studying later.
<br/>
<div class="a"><pre> Frame myFrame = new Frame(
 "Copyright, R.G.Baldwin");
 myFrame.setLayout(null<b>)</b>;</pre></div>
In this particular example, we don't want to accept the default layout.
Rather, we want to be able to specify the location and size of our components
in absolute coordinates . Therefore, we will <u>override the default</u>
layout with a specification of a <b>null</b> layout as a parameter to the
<b>setLayout()</b> method.

<p>The <b>setLayout()</b> method is a method of the <b>Container</b> class,
of which the <b>Frame</b> class is a subclass. The <b>setLayout()</b> method
requires an object of the <b>LayoutManager</b> class or <b>null</b> (indicating
no layout manager) as a parameter.
<h4><font color="#ff0000">Add the Components to the Frame</font></h4>
The next interesting code fragment causes the two previously defined components
to become part of the composite visual object through use of the <b>add()</b>
method of the class <b>Container</b>. This method is inherited by the <b>Frame</b>
class which is a subclass of <b>Container</b>.

<p>As of 3/6/97, there are five overloaded versions of the <b>add()</b>
method. We are using the version that requires an object of type <b>Component</b>
as a parameter. Since our <b>Button</b> and <b>Label</b> objects are subclasses
of the <b>Component</b> class, they qualify as parameters allowing us to
use the following code:
<br/>
<div class="a"><pre> myFrame.add(myButton);
 myFrame.add(myLabel);</pre></div>

<h4><font color="#ff0000">Size the Frame and Make It Visible</font></h4>
Once we reach this point, all that is left to cause our GUI to appear on
the screen at program startup is to establish the size of the <b>Frame</b>
object in pixels, and to make it <i>visible</i>. We accomplish this with
the following two statements:
<br/>
<div class="a"><pre> myFrame.setSize(250,150);
 myFrame.setVisible(true);</pre></div>
A complete listing of the program is provided in the next section.

The complete listing of the program with additional comments follows.
<br/>
<div class="a"><pre>/*File Layout01.java Copyright, R.G.Baldwin
Revised 10/27/97 to improve the layout on the page.

This program is designed to be compiled and run under
JDK 1.1

The program shows how to use the new methods in JDK 1.1 to
set the size and position of components in a Frame object
using absolute coordinates.

The program also illustrates some of the problems
associated with the use of absolute coordinates.

A button and a yellow label are placed in a Frame object.
Note that the two objects may overlap, and that the initial
height of the Frame object may clip off the bottom of the
Label.

Note also that if the Frame is resized by the user, the
Button and the Label remain fixed in size and position.
The Frame can be resized to the point where the two
components are no longer visible.

Note also that the specified size of the Label may not be
sufficient to display all of the initial text placed in the
label.

For simplicity, no event handler is provided for the Button
and no event handler is provided for the "Close" button on
the Frame. Therefore, it is necessary to terminate the
program using some other method.

The program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 running under Win95.

object.

<p>While continuing to use absolute coordinate and sizing, modify the program
to ensure that the components don't overlap, there is a safety margin of
at least 25 pixels between the components and the edge of the client area
in the Frame object, and that the Frame object is sufficiently large to

Without viewing the following solution, upgrade the
program named Layout01 to cause it to terminate when the
close button is pressed on the Frame object.

While continuing to use absolute coordinate and sizing,
modify the program to ensure that the components don't
overlap, there is a safety margin of at least 25 pixels
between the components and the edge of the Frame object,
and that the Frame object is sufficiently large to
contain the two components.

This program is designed to be compiled and run under
JDK 1.1

A button and a yellow label are placed in a Frame object.

Note that with JDK 1.1.3, if the top margin is set to zero,
the button is partially covered by the banner at the top
of the Frame object. Thus, the vertical coordinate of the
white portion of the client area in the Frame object does
not begin at zero. Rather, the zero coordinate is
somewhere underneath the banner. Experimentation indicates
that the banner at the top covers about the first twenty
pixels of the white client area of the Frame object.

Note that if the Frame is resized by the user, the
Button and the Label remain fixed in size and position.
The Frame can be resized to the point where the two
components are no longer visible.

Note also that the specified size of the Label may not be
sufficient to display all of the initial text placed in the
label.

For simplicity, no event handler is provided for the
Button.

The program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 running under Win95.
