<p>This chapter is part of a series of chapters designed to 
teach you how to use several important features the new features of the focus 
subsystem.</p>
<p>The first chapter in the series was entitled 
<a href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/2198221">Focus 
Traversal Policies in Java Version 1.4</a>. The previous chapter was 
entitled <a href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3432871">The 
Opposite Focus Component</a>.</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Previous topics</b></font></p>
<p>Previous chapters in this series have dealt with several aspects of the new focus subsystem, 
including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Defining new focus traversal keys</li>
	<li>How to control focusability at runtime.</li>
	<li>The ability to query for the currently focused Component.</li>
	<li>The default Focus Traversal Policy.</li>
	<li>How to establish a focus traversal policy and modify it at runtime.</li>
	<li>How to control the focus programmatically.</li>
	<li>Opposite components.</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter will show you how to use the <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> interface.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What do we mean by focus?</b></font></p>
<p>One of the ways to describe <i>focus</i> is as follows. Among all of 
the applications showing on the desktop at any point in time, only one will 
respond to the keyboard. We will refer to that application as the <i>
active </i>application.</p>
<p>If the <i>active</i> application is a Java application, only one component 
within that application's graphical user interface <i>(GUI)</i> will respond to 
the keyboard. That is the component that has the <i>focus</i> at that 
point in time.</p>
<p>A Java component that has the focus also has the ability to fire <b>KeyEvents</b> when it responds to the keyboard.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What does Sun have to say?</b></font></p>
<p>Before getting into the technical details, I will provide some quotations 
from Sun that describe a <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b>. In discussing the changes to the 
focus subsystem, Sun has this to say:</p>
<p><i>&quot;While the user's <b>KeyEvents</b> should generally be delivered to the 
focus owner, there are rare cases where this is not desirable. ...</i></p>
<p><i>A <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> is a lightweight interface that allows client 
code to <b>pre-listen</b> to all <b>KeyEvents</b> in a particular context.</i></p>
<p><i>Instances of classes that implement the interface and are registered with 
the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> will receive <b>KeyEvents</b> before 
they are dispatched to the focus owner, allowing the <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> 
to retarget the event, consume it, dispatch it itself, or make other changes.
</i></p>
<p><i>... if a <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> reports that it dispatched the <b>
KeyEvent</b>, regardless of whether it actually did so, the <b>
KeyboardFocusManager</b> will take no further action with regard to the <b>
KeyEvent</b>.&quot;</i></p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">Viewing tip</font></b> </p>
 
<p>You may find it useful to open another copy of this chapter in a separate
 browser window. That will make it easier for you to scroll back and
 forth among the different figures and listings while you are reading about
 them. </p>

<p>In this chapter, I will show you how to use <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects 
to cause a <b>KeyEvent</b> fired by one component to be dispatched to a 
different component for processing.</p>
<p>Using a sample program, characters typed into one text field in a GUI will 
appear in another text field belonging to the same GUI. Those characters 
will not appear in the text field into which they are typed.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Discussion_and_Sample_Code">Discussion and Sample 
Code</a></h2>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Description of the program</b></font></p>
<p>This chapter presents and explains a sample program named <b>KeyEventDispatch01</b>.</p>
<p>This program illustrates the use of a <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> as an 
alternative to the default dispatching of key events.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The program GUI</b></font></p>
<p>The program causes a single <b>JFrame</b> object to appear on the screen as 
shown in Figure 1.</p>
<div align="center">
<div class="a">                    
<pre><img border="0" src="java1855a.gif" width="391" height="101">

<b>Figure 1 Program GUI.</b>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>The <b>JFrame</b> object contains three <b>JTextField</b> objects. The initial text in 
the three <b>JTextField</b> objects is respectively: 
 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Field A 
	</li>
	<li>Field B 
	</li>
	<li>Field C </li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Two KeyEventDispatcher objects</b></font></p>
<p>Two different <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects are 
registered on the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> 
in the following order <i>(this is one case in Java where the order of 
registration is important):</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>AlternateDispatcherA </li>
	<li>AlternateDispatcherB </li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>When a KeyEvent occurs ...</b></font></p>
<p>When a <b>KeyEvent</b> occurs, the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> delivers that event to 
the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> object for dispatching. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Events are delivered to multiple registered <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects in the 
order in which they are registered.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>If the focus owner is <i>Field A ...</i></b></font></p>
<p>If the 
owner of the focus at that point in time <i>(the source of the event)</i> is 
<i>Field A,</i> the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> object 
<i>re-dispatches</i> that event to <i>Field C</i> and returns 
<b>true</b>. This causes keystrokes entered into <i>Field A</i> to appear in <i>Field C</i> instead 
of appearing in <i>Field A.</i> </p>
<p>Returning 
<b>true</b> prevents any further dispatching of the 
event by the <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b>. 
 
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>If the source of the event is not <i>Field A ...</i></b></font></p>
<p>If the source of the event is not <i>Field A,</i> the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> object 
returns <b>false</b>. This causes the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> to deliver the event to 
<b>AlternateDispatcherB</b> for dispatching. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>If the source of the event is <i>Field B ...</i></b></font></p>
<p>If the 
owner of the focus at that point in time is 
<i>Field B, </i>the <b>AlternateDispatcherB</b> object 
<i>re-dispatches </i>that event to <i>Field C</i> and returns 
<b>true</b>. This causes keystrokes entered into 
<i>Field B</i> to appear in <i>Field C</i> instead of appearing in <i>Field B.</i> </p>
<p>Returning 
<b>true</b> prevents any further dispatching of the 
event. 
 
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>If the source of the event is not <i>Field B ...</i></b></font></p>
<p>If the owner of the focus at that point in time 
is not <i>Field B,</i> the <b>AlternateDispatcherB</b> object 
returns <b>false</b>.</p>
<p>This causes the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> to dispatch the event to 
the component that owns the focus, which is what normally happens in the absence 
of registered <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Must be <i>Field C</i> </b></font> </p>
<p>In this 
program, that would have to be <i>Field C</i> 
because it has already been determined that 
neither <i>Field A</i> nor <i>Field B</i> owns the focus. 
 
This causes keystrokes entered into <i>Field C</i> to 
appear in <i>Field C</i> as normal.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>All keystrokes appear in <i>Field C</i></b></font></p>
<p>Thus, all keystrokes entered into any of the 
three fields in the GUI in Figure 1 will appear in <i>Field C.</i> 
 
</p>
<p>This program was tested using J2SE 1.4.2 under WinXP.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The state of the GUI</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the state of the GUI after the characters a, b, and c, were entered respectively into fields A, B, and C, in that order. Note 
that all three characters, abc, appear in <i>Field C.</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Will discuss in fragments</b></font></p>
<p>I will discuss this program in fragments. A complete listing of the 
program is provided in Listing 10 near the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>Listing 1 shows the class named <b>KeyEventDispatch01</b>, including 
the <b>main</b> method.</p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>
class KeyEventDispatch01{
  public static void <b>main</b>(String[] args){
    new GUI();
  }//end main
}//end class KeyEventDispatch01

<b>Listing 1</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>In this case, the <b>main</b> method simply instantiates an object of the <b>
GUI</b> class. The object of the <b>GUI</b> class appears in Figure 1.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The GUI class</b></font></p>
<p>Listing 2 shows the beginning of the <b>GUI</b> class, which extends the <b>
JFrame</b> class. Thus, a <b>GUI</b> object is also a <b>JFrame</b> 
object.</p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>
class <b>GUI</b> extends <b>JFrame</b>{
  JTextField fieldA =
                    new JTextField("Field A",12);
  JTextField fieldB =
                    new JTextField("Field B",12);
  JTextField fieldC =
                    new JTextField("Field C",12);

  KeyboardFocusManager manager;

<b>Listing 2</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>Listing 2 declares and initializes the three <b>JTextField</b> objects shown 
in Figure 1.</p>
<p>Listing 2 also declares a reference variable named <b>manager</b> that will 
be used to hold a reference to the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> object.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The constructor</b></font></p>
<p>The constructor for the <b>GUI</b> class begins in Listing 3.</p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>
  GUI(){//constructor
    getContentPane().setLayout(new FlowLayout());
    getContentPane().add(fieldA);
    getContentPane().add(fieldB);
    getContentPane().add(fieldC);

    setSize(390,100);
    setTitle("Copyright, R.G. Baldwin");
    setDefaultCloseOperation(
                           JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    setVisible(true);

<b>Listing 3</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>The code in Listing 3 is completely straightforward. Code like this has 
been included in hundreds of previous tutorials to create a graphical user 
interface and to cause it to appear on the screen.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The current KeyboardFocusManager</b></font></p>
<p>Continuing with the constructor, the statement in Listing 4 is new to this chapter.</p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>
    manager = KeyboardFocusManager.
                getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager();

<b>Listing 4</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>Listing 4 invokes the static <b>getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager</b> method of 
the <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> class to gain 
access to the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> object.</p>
<p>The object's 
reference is saved in the variable named <b>manager</b> that was declared in 
Listing 2.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What is a KeyboardFocusManager object</b></font></p>
<p>According to Sun,</p>
<p><i>&quot;The <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> is responsible for managing the active 
and focused <b>Windows</b>, and the current focus owner. </i></p>
<p><i>The focus owner is defined as the <b>Component</b> in an application that 
will typically receive all <b>KeyEvents</b> generated by the user. </i></p>
<p><i>The focused <b>Window</b> is the <b>Window</b> that is, or contains, the 
focus owner. Only a <b>Frame</b> or a <b>Dialog</b> can be the active <b>Window</b>.</i></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Note that <b>JFrame</b> extends <b>Frame</b>, and <b>JDialog</b> 
	extends <b>Dialog </b>- Baldwin.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The native windowing system may denote the active <b>Window</b> or its 
children with special decorations, such as a highlighted title bar. The active
<b>Window</b> is always either the focused <b>Window</b>, or the first <b>Frame</b> 
or <b>Dialog</b> that is an owner of the focused Window. </i></p>
<p><i>The <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> is both a centralized location for client 
code to query for the focus owner and initiate focus changes, and an event 
dispatcher for all <b>FocusEvents</b>, <b>WindowEvents</b> related to focus, and
<b>KeyEvents</b>.</i>&quot;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Many methods are available</b></font></p>
<p>A <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> object provides more than fifty different 
methods that can be used by client code for <i>&quot;managing the active and focused <b>
Windows</b>, and the current focus owner.&quot;</i> <i> </i></p>
<p>I will be using several of those methods in this chapter. The first 
such method that I will use is the static <b>getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager</b> 
method shown in Listing 4. As explained earlier, this method returns a 
reference to the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> object.</p>
<p>In addition, I will also be using the following methods in subsequent code:</p>
<ul>
	<li>addKeyEventDispatcher</li>
	<li>redispatchEvent</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Registering KeyEventDispatcher objects</b></font></p>
<p>This program defines two different classes that implement the <b>
KeyEventDispatcher</b> interface:</p>
<ul>
	<li>AlternateDispatcherA</li>
	<li>AlternateDispatcherB</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuing with the constructor, the code in Listing 5 registers one object of each of those 
two classes on the <b>
KeyboardFocusManager</b>. Registration makes it possible to <i>&quot;pre-listen to all <b>KeyEvents</b>&quot;</i> and to 
take appropriate action when a <b>KeyEvent</b> occurs.</p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>
    manager.addKeyEventDispatcher(
                        new AlternateDispatcherA(
                         fieldA,fieldC,manager));
    manager.addKeyEventDispatcher(
                        new AlternateDispatcherB(
                         fieldB,fieldC,manager));

  }//end constructor
}//end class GUI

<b>Listing 5</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>I will explain what I mean by <i>appropriate action</i> later.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>End of the GUI class</b></font></p>
<p>Listing 5 also signals the end of the constructor and the end of the <b>GUI</b> 
class.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The AlternateDispatcherA class</b></font></p>
<p>One of the classes that implement the <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> interface is 
named <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b>.</p>
<p>Listing 6 shows the beginning of the class named <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b>. </p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>
class AlternateDispatcherA
                   implements KeyEventDispatcher{
  JTextField fieldA;
  JTextField fieldC;
  KeyboardFocusManager manager;

<b>Listing 6</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(An object instantiated from the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> class is registered on the
	<b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> in 
Listing 5.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listing 6 declares three instance variables that will be populated by the 
constructor.</p>
<p>References to the three text fields shown in Figure 1, as well as a 
reference to the <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> are required to make it possible 
for an object of this class to provide the <i>appropriate action</i> mentioned 
earlier.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The constructor</b></font></p>
<p>Listing 7 shows the constructor for the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> class. </p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>
  AlternateDispatcherA(
                   JTextField fieldA,
                   JTextField fieldC,
                   KeyboardFocusManager manager){
    this.fieldA = fieldA;
    this.fieldC = fieldC;
    this.manager = manager;
  }//end constructor

<b>Listing 7</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>The code in the constructor receives the incoming references and saves them 
in the instance variables declared in Listing 6.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The dispatchKeyEvent method</b></font></p>
<p>The <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> interface declares a single method named <b>
dispatchKeyEvent</b>. All classes that implement the interface must 
provide a concrete definition of this method. This is the method whose 
behavior performs the <i>appropriate action</i> mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What does Sun have to say?</b></font></p>
<p>Here is part of what Sun has to say about the <b>dispatchKeyEvent</b> method.</p>
<p><i>&quot;This method is called by the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> 
requesting that this <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> dispatch the specified event on 
its behalf. This <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> is free to retarget the event, 
consume it, dispatch it itself, or make other changes. </i></p>
<p><i>This capability is typically used to deliver <b>KeyEvents</b> to <b>
Components</b> other than the focus owner.</i></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(That is what is done in this sample program - Baldwin.) </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>... Note that if a <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> dispatches the <b>KeyEvent</b> 
itself, it must use <b>redispatchEvent</b> to prevent the current <b>
KeyboardFocusManager</b> from recursively requesting that this <b>
KeyEventDispatcher</b> dispatch the event again. </i></p>
<p><i>If an implementation of this method returns <b>false</b>, then the <b>
KeyEvent</b> is passed to the next <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> in the chain, 
ending with the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b>. </i></p>
<p><i>If an implementation returns <b>true</b>, the <b>KeyEvent</b> is assumed 
to have been dispatched (although this need not be the case), and the current <b>
KeyboardFocusManager</b> will take no further action with regard to the <b>
KeyEvent</b>.&quot;</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Definition of the dispatchKeyEvent method</b></font></p>
<p>Listing 8 shows the definition of the <b>dispatchKeyEvent</b> method in the
<b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> class.</p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>
  public boolean <b>dispatchKeyEvent</b>(KeyEvent e){
    if(e.getSource() == fieldA){
      manager.<b>redispatchEvent</b>(fieldC,e);
      return true;
    }else{
      return false;
    }//end else
  }//end dispatchKeyEvent
}//end class AlternateDispatcherA

<b>Listing 8</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Note that the dispatchKeyEvent method receives a reference to the <b>
	KeyEvent</b> object.</i><b><i>)</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Is <i>Field A</i> the source of the event?</b></font></p>
<p>The code in Listing 8 begins by testing to see if the source of the <b>KeyEvent</b> is 
the <b>JTextField</b> object referred to by <b>fieldA</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(This is the text field identified as Field A in Figure 1.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If so, the code in Listing 8 invokes the <b>redispatchEvent</b> method to 
<i>re-dispatch</i> the event to the <b>JTextField</b> object referred to by <b>fieldC</b>. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(This is the text field identified as Field C in Figure 1.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This causes <i>Field C</i> to respond to the event instead of <i>Field A</i>.</p>
<p>The normal response of a 
text field to a <b>KeyEvent</b> is to display the character associated with the key that was 
pressed to 
cause the <b>KeyEvent</b> to be fired.</p>
<p>As a result, characters typed into <i>Field A</i> in Figure 1 appear in <i>Field C</i> instead of 
<i>Field A.</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The redispatchEvent method</b></font></p>
<p>What does it mean to <i>dispatch</i> an event to a component? One way 
to think of this is to deliver the event object to the component and to ask the 
component to deal with it in whatever way is appropriate for that component.
</p>
<p>For example, when a <b>KeyEvent</b> of a particular type is dispatched to a 
text field, the appropriate behavior is for the text field to extract the 
character from the event object and to display that character in the text field. 
That character is also combined with other characters and saved in such a way 
that it is possible later to get the character content of the text field by 
invoking a method on the text field.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Experimentation indicates that this happens for a <b>KeyEvent</b> of 
	type <b>keyPressed</b>, as opposed to type <b>keyReleased</b> or type <b>
	keyTyped</b>.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figure 2 contains some of what Sun has to say about the <b>redispatchEvent</b> 
method of the <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> class.</p>
<div align="left">
<div class="a">public final void redispatchEvent(<br/>
			 <b>Component</b>target, <b>
			AWTEvent</b>e)<p>Re-dispatches an <b>AWTEvent</b> in such a way that 
			the AWT event dispatcher will not recursively request that the <b>
			KeyboardFocusManager</b>, or any installed <b>KeyEventDispatchers</b>, 
			dispatch the event again. </p>
			<p>Client implementations of <b>dispatchEvent</b> and client-defined
			<b>KeyEventDispatchers</b> must call <b>redispatchEvent(target, e)</b> 
			instead of <b>target.dispatchEvent(e)</b> to dispatch an event.</p>
			<p>Parameters: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>target</b> - the Component to which the event should be 
				dispatched</li>
				<li><b>e</b> - the event to dispatch </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Figure 2<br/>
</div>
</div>
<p>Given the above discussion, Figure 2 should be relatively self-explanatory.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The return value</b></font></p>
<p>Returning now to the code in Listing 8, after re-dispatching the <b>KeyEvent</b> 
to <i>Field C,</i> the <b>dispatchKeyEvent</b> method returns <b>true</b>. 
This causes the <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> to assume that the <b>KeyEvent</b> 
has been dispatched. It will take no further action with respect to that
<b>KeyEvent</b>.</p>
<p>If the source of the <b>KeyEvent</b> in Listing 8 was not <i>Field A,</i> the
<b>dispatchKeyEvent</b> method returns <b>false</b>. This causes the <b>
KeyboardFocusManager</b> to pass the <b>KeyEvent</b> to the <b>
KeyEventDispatcher</b> of type <b>AlternateDispatcherB</b> that was also 
registered on the <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Recall that events are delivered to multiple registered <b>
	KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects in the order in which they were registered on 
	the <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b>.)</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The AlternateDispatcherB class</b></font></p>
</p>
<p>The <b>AlternateDispatcherB</b> class is shown in Listing 9. This class 
is very similar to the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> class shown in Listings 6, 7, 
and 8.</p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>

<p>The main difference between the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> class and the <b>
AlternateDispatcherB</b> class is:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The<b> dispatchKeyEvent</b> method in the<b> AlternateDispatcherB</b> 
	class re-dispatches the event to <i>Field C</i> if the source of the <b>
	KeyEvent</b> is <i><b>Field B</b>. </i>In contrast, the<b> 
	dispatchKeyEvent</b> method in the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> class 
	re-dispatches the event to <i>Field C</i> if the source of the <b>KeyEvent</b> 
	is <i><b>Field A</b>. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This causes characters entered into <i>Field B</i> to appear in <i>Field C</i> 
instead of appearing in <i>Field B.</i></p>

Revised 07/27/04

This program illustrates the use of an
alternate KeyEventDispatcher.

A JFrame object appears on the screen containing
three JTextField objects.  The initial text in
the three JTextField objects is respectively:

Field A
Field B
Field C

Two alternative KeyEventDispatcher objects are
registered on the current KeyboardFocusManager
in the following order:

AlternateDispatcherA
AlternateDispatcherB

When a key event occurs, the current
KeyboardFocusManager delivers that event to
AlternateDispatcherA for dispatching.  If the
owner of the focus at that point in time is
Field A, the AlternateDispatcherA object
re-dispatches that event to Field C and returns
true.  That causes keystrokes entered into
Field A to appear in Field C instead.  Returning
true prevents any further dispatching of the
event.

If the owner of the focus at that point in time
is not Field A, the AlternateDispatcherA object
returns false.  This causes the current
KeyboardFocusManager to deliver the event to
AlternateDispatcherB for dispatching.  If the
owner of the focus at that point in time is
Field B, the AlternateDispatcherB object
re-dispatches that event to Field C and returns
true.  That causes keystrokes entered into
Field B to appear in Field C instead.  Returning
true prevents any further dispatching of the
event.

If the owner of the focus at that point in time
is not Field B, the AlternateDispatcherB object
returns false.  This causes the current
KeyboardFocusManager to dispatch the event to
the component that owns the focus.  In this
simple program, that would have to be Field C
because it has already been determined that
neither Field A nor Field B own the focus.

That causes keystrokes entered into Field C to
appear in Field C as is normally the case.

Thus, all keystrokes entered into any of the
three fields in the GUI will appear in field C.

Tested using J2SE 1.4.2 under WinXP.
