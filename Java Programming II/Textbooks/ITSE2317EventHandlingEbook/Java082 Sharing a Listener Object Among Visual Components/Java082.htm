<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Earlier chapters discussed the sharing of a single event <em>source</em> 
object among two or more <em>listener</em> objects for <em>low-level </em>
events.</p>
<p>This chapter discusses the sharing of a single listener object among two 
or more visual components for <em>low-level events</em> generated by any of the 
visual components. </p>
<p>The event-handling method of the listener object </p>
<ul>
	<li>responds to each event,</li>
	<li>determines which visual component generated the event, and</li>
	<li>takes the appropriate action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary issue in this type of operation boils down to determining which 
component generated the event. </p>
<p>This can be accomplished by assigning a unique name to each visual component when 
it is instantiated and using that name to distinguish among the visual 
components when an event occurs. </p>
<p>This approach is completely straightforward and intuitive. An improved 
approach to accomplishing the same objective is illustrated in some sample 
programs near the end of the chapter. While possibly less intuitive, the improved 
approach is more object-oriented and probably easier to maintain. </p>
	
	<h1><a name="First_sample_program">First sample program</a></h1>
	
	<p>This program illustrates the sharing of a single listener object among 
	two different visual components of the same type. </p>
<p>The program detects mouse events occurring on either of two different <strong>Frame</strong> objects. It distinguishes between the two objects on the basis 
of the component name, and displays the coordinates of a mouse click on 
whichever object experienced the mouse click. </p>
<p>This program was originally tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95. More recently 
it was tested using JDK 12.0.1 and Windows 7.</p>
<p>Note that when the program starts, the two visual components overlay one 
another. It is necessary to physically move one of them in order to access the 
other as shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>. </p>

<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Figure_1">Figure 1.</a> Screen output from Event10.</p>
<p><img alt="Two Frame objects showing mousePressed coordinates." height="212" src="event10a.jpg" width="617"/></p>
</div>





<h2><a name="Interesting_code_fragments">Interesting code fragments</a></h2>

<p>This program is really quite simple. The only new code involves cracking the 
event object to obtain the name of the visual component that generated the
<strong>mousePressed</strong> event. </p>
<p>The <strong>main</strong> method instantiates an object of type <strong>GUI</strong>
<em>(named gui)</em> which serves the purpose of providing the visual interface.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Frame </strong>class is <em>extended </em>into a new class named
<strong>MyFrame </strong>to make it possible to override the <strong>paint</strong> 
method of the class. This is necessary to display the coordinates of mouse 
clicks on the interior of the frame using the graphics method named <strong>
drawString</strong>. </p>
<h3><a name="The_Event_Source_Objects">The Event Source Objects</a></h3>
<p>The constructor of the <strong>GUI</strong> class instantiates two objects of 
type <strong>MyFrame </strong>and makes them visible. This is accomplished using 
code such as that shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a>.</p>

<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_1">Listing 1.</a> An event source object.
</p>
<pre>
    MyFrame myFrame1 = new MyFrame("Frame1");
    myFrame1.setVisible(true);
</pre>
</div>
<p>The reference variables for the two objects are named <strong>myFrame1</strong> 
and <strong>myFrame2</strong>.</p>
<h3><a name="Unique_names">Unique names</a></h3>
<p>When they are instantiated, unique names <em>(<strong>Frame1</strong> and 
<strong>Frame2</strong>)</em> are given to the objects using code in the 
constructor <em>(see <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>)</em> for the extended <strong>Frame </strong>objects <em>(the </em>
<strong><em>MyFrame </em></strong><em>class extends the </em><strong><em>Frame
</em></strong><em>class in order to override its </em><strong><em>paint</em></strong><em> 
method).</em> </p>





<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_2">Listing 2.</a> Give the source objects unique names.
</p>
<pre>
  MyFrame(String name){//constructor
    setTitle("Copyright, R.G.Baldwin");
    setSize(300,200);
    //Name used to distinguish between the two objects
    setName(name);
  }//end constructor
</pre>
</div>
<p>The unique names are used later by the listener object to determine which 
object generated a mouse event. </p>
<h3><a name="Instantiate_and_register_mouse_listener_object">Instantiate and 
register mouse listener object</a></h3>
<p>The constructor in the <strong>GUI</strong> class also uses the code in 
<a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> to instantiate a single listener object which will process low-level 
mouse events on either of the two visual objects. </p>




<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_3">Listing 3.</a> Instantiate and register mouse listener 
object.
</p>
<pre>
    MouseProc mouseProcCmd = new MouseProc(myFrame1,myFrame2);
    myFrame1.addMouseListener(mouseProcCmd);
    myFrame2.addMouseListener(mouseProcCmd);
</pre>
</div>
<p>The first statement in <a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> instantiates the new listener object named <strong>mouseProcCmd</strong> passing references to the two visual components as 
parameters. </p>
<p>The next two statements add that listener object (<em>register</em> the 
listener object) to a list of listener objects that are automatically notified 
whenever mouse events occur on the visual objects referred to as <strong>
myFrame1</strong> and <strong>myFrame2</strong>, respectively. </p>
<p>You will recall that once the programmer causes the name of a listener object 
to be added to the list, no further programming effort is required to cause the 
notification to occur. </p>
<p>The notifications are carried out by invoking specific overridden instance 
methods of the listener object upon the occurrence of a specific types of mouse 
events. </p>
<p>The declarations for all of the methods that match up with all of the 
possible mouse event types are defined by the <strong>MouseListener</strong> 
interface that matches the <strong>MouseEvent</strong>  class. </p>
<p>The class from which the listener object is instantiated 
must define, either directly or indirectly, all the methods declared in the
<strong>MouseListener</strong> interface. </p>
<h3><a name="Instantiate_and_register_window_listener_object">Instantiate and register 
window listener object</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the <em>registration</em> of the <strong>MouseListener</strong> 
object to receive mouse events, the program also instantiates and <em>registers</em> 
a listener object that monitors for <strong>Window</strong>  events and 
terminates the program whenever the user closes either of the two visual 
objects. In this case, the code in the listener object makes no attempt to 
distinguish between the two visual objects. The instantiation and registration 
code is shown in <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a>. </p>




<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_4">Listing 4.</a> Instantiate and register window listener object.
	</p>
<pre>
    WProc1 winProcCmd1 = new WProc1();
    myFrame1.addWindowListener(winProcCmd1);
    myFrame2.addWindowListener(winProcCmd1);
</pre>
</div>
<h3><a name="The_MouseListener_object">The MouseListener object</a></h3>
<p>Most of the programming complexity is tied up in the <strong>mouseListener
</strong>object, and even that isn't very complicated. </p>
<p>The central issue for the code in the listener object is how 
to determine which one of several visual components generated an event. </p>
<p>This particular listener object only responds to <strong>
mousePressed</strong> events, but the following information applies to all of 
the different types of mouse events, and probably to most or all of the 
low-level events as well. </p>
<p>The <strong>MouseProc</strong> <em>(listener)</em> class in this program </p>
<ul>
	<li>extends the <strong>MouseAdapter</strong> class and</li>
	<li>overrides the <strong>mousePressed</strong> method that is declared in 
	the <strong>MouseListener </strong>interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will recall that the <strong>MouseAdapter</strong> class overrides all of 
the methods of the <strong>MouseListener </strong>interface with empty methods, 
thus freeing our code from the requirement to override all of those methods.</p>
<p>When the <strong>mousePressed</strong> method is invoked, an object of type
<strong>MouseEvent</strong> <em>(known locally as <strong>e</strong>)</em> is 
passed in as a parameter. </p>
<h3><a name="Identify_the_event_source">Identify the event source</a></h3>
<p>The statement in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> was used in the <strong>MouseListener </strong>object 
to determine if the name of the object that generated the event is <strong>
Frame1</strong>. </p>





<div class="a">
	<p>
<a name="Listing_5">Listing 5.</a> Identify the event source.
</p>
<pre>
if( e.getComponent().getName().compareTo("Frame1") == 0 ){
</pre>
</div>
<p>If it is determined that the name of the component that generated the event 
is <strong>Frame1</strong>, code is executed to display the coordinates of the 
mouse pointer on the visual object named <strong>Frame1</strong>. </p>
<p>Otherwise, an <strong>else</strong> clause is used to display the coordinate 
information on the visual object named <strong>Frame2</strong>. <em>(No provisions 
were made for the event to have been generated by any visual objects other than 
these two.) </em> </p>
<p>The code to display the coordinate information is essentially the same as was 
discussed in a similar program in an earlier chapter, so it won't be 
discussed again here. </p>
<h3><a name="Cracking_the_MouseEvent_object">Cracking the MouseEvent object</a></h3>
<p>Now let's take a look at the details of cracking the <strong>MouseEvent</strong> object to 
obtain the name of the visual component that generated the event. </p>
<p>The <strong>getComponent</strong> method is a method of the <strong>
java.awt.event.ComponentEvent</strong> class which, according to the JDK 1.1 
documentation, <em>"Returns the component where this event originated." </em>It 
is returned as an object of type <strong>Component </strong>which is acted upon 
by the <strong>getName</strong> method in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. </p>
<p>The <strong>getName</strong> method was added to the <strong>
java.awt.Component</strong> class by JDK 1.1. This method <em>"Gets the name of 
the component"</em> and returns it as a <strong>String </strong>object. The
<strong>String </strong>object is acted upon by the <strong>compareTo</strong> 
method in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a>. </p>
<p>The <strong>compareTo</strong> method is a standard method of the <strong>
String</strong> class, carried forward from JDK 1.0.2, that can be used to 
compare two <strong>String </strong>objects. It is used to determine if the name 
of the component matches the String "<em>Frame1"</em>. </p>
<p>Note that it is also possible to perform tests directly on the <strong>
MouseEvent </strong>object to match it to a component name. The procedure for 
doing this will be included in a future chapter. </p>
<p>By the way, in case you haven't noticed, the <strong>java.awt.event</strong> 
package is different from the <strong>java.awt</strong> package. The <strong>
java.awt.event</strong> package was added in JDK 1.1. It can be very confusing 
if you drop into the <strong>java.awt</strong> package of the documentation when 
you really need to be in <strong>java.awt.event</strong>. </p>
<h3><a name="The_WindowListener_Object">The WindowListener Object</a></h3>
<p>This program also contains a <strong>WindowListener </strong>object, which 
terminates the program whenever the user closes either of the <strong>Frame
</strong>objects. Except for the fact that this object is registered to receive
<strong>Window </strong>events from either of the two <strong>Frame </strong>
objects, it is no different from similar listeners used in an 
earlier sample program, and therefore, won't be discussed further here. </p>
<p>Note that an improved version of this program is presented at the end of this 
chapter. The improved version does not require the establishment of 
source object names, and does not require the passing of references to 
the constructor for the <strong>WindowListener </strong>in order to distinguish 
between the two sources. You should become familiar with the methodology 
used in the improved version as well as the methodology used in the following 
version. </p>

/*File Event10.java Copyright, R.G.Baldwin
This program is designed to be compiled and run under 
JDK 1.1

The program illustrates the sharing of a single listener 
object among two different visual components of the same 
type.

The program detects mouse events occurring on either of two
different Frame objects.  It distinguishes between the two
objects on the basis of the component name, and displays 
the coordinates of a mouse click on whichever object 
experienced the mouse click.

This program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95.

Note that when the program starts, the two visual 
components overlay one another.  It is necessary to move 
one of them in order to access the other.

<p>A single listener object can be registered to process events of a given class 
generated by two or more different visual objects. </p>
<p>Unique names can be assigned to the objects when they are instantiated. </p>
<p>When an event occurs, the code in the listener object can obtain the name of 
the visual object that generated the event and use it to distinguish among the 
objects. </p>
<p>The name of the object that generated the event can be determined using the 
statement shown in <a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> where </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>e </strong>is the local name of the object passed into the 
	low-level event-handling method, and</li>
	<li><strong>"Frame1"</strong> is a string being tested against the component 
	name of a visual object that may have generated the event.</li>
</ul>






<h2><a name="Changes_relative_to_Event10">Changes relative to Event10</a></h2>
<p>Although the program named <strong>Event10</strong> discussed above used two 
visual objects of the same type, there is no reason that the visual objects have 
to be of the same type, as long as all of the visual objects that share the
<strong>listener </strong>object are 
capable of generating events of the event class for which the listener is 
designed. </p>
<p>This is illustrated by the program named <strong>Event11</strong> <em>(see 
<a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a>)</em> 
that modifies the program named <strong>Event10</strong> to use </p>
<ul>
	<li>a visual Frame object and</li>
	<li>a visual Window object,</li>
</ul>
<p>instead of two <strong>Frame</strong> objects. </p>
<p>The screen output is shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>.</p>

	</div>




<p><em>(Note that the </em> <strong><em>Window</em></strong><em> object, shown 
as the white square in </em><a href="#Figure_2"><em>Figure 2</em></a><em>, doesn't have a banner that 
allows it to be physically moved with the mouse. Therefore, I called the </em> <strong>
<em>setBounds</em></strong><em> 
method on both objects to separate them and to place them in a location on the screen 
where I could display the white </em> <strong><em>Window</em></strong><em> object against the black background 
of the command-line window.)</em></p>
<p>The ability to display the coordinates of mouse clicks was also removed for 
simplification of the program. Information about mouse clicks is displayed in 
the command-line window as shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>. The operation of the program is discussed in the 
comments in <a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a>. </p>
<p>Note that an improved version of this program is also presented at the end of this 
chapter. The improved version does not require the establishment of source object names, and does not require the passing of references to

This program is designed to be compiled and run under 
JDK 1.1

The program illustrates the sharing of a single listener 
object between two different visual components of 
different types.

The program detects mouse events occurring on either a 
visual Frame object or on a visual Window object.  It 
distinguishes between the two objects on the basis of the
component name, and displays a message indicating which
object generated the event.

Clicking inside the Frame object but outside the Window 
object produces the following message:

Got mousePressed event from Frame object

Clicking inside the Window object produces the following 
message:

Got mousePressed event from Window object

Closing the Frame object produces the following message 
and terminates the program:

Got windowClosing event from Frame object

These results were produced using JDK 1.1.3, running under 
Windows 95.
