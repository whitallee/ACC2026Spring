<h1 ><a name="introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b></h1>

<p>To begin with, what is Swing? </p>

<p>Swing is the name given to a new set of lightweight components developed by 
Sun to supplement <em>(and possibly replace)</em> the components in the AWT. <em>(The general topic of lightweight components is covered in a separate chapter.)</em> 
With the exception of top-level containers, Swing components are developed 
completely using Java and don't depend on the <i>peer</i>
component rendering provided by the operating system. </p>

<p>Swing components have several advantages over AWT components, and probably 
some disadvantages as well. </p>

<p>One of the advantages is that because the components are not rendered on the 
screen by the operating system, the look and feel of a component does not change 
as the application is executed on different platforms running under 
different operating systems. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it is possible to cause Swing components to mimic the look and 
feel of a specific platform no matter what platform the program is running on. 
This is known as <i>pluggable look and feel</i>.</p>

<p>From this point forward 
in this eBook, I will attempt to incorporate Swing into the chapters 
in a meaningful way. </p>

<p>Swing components support the 
JDK 1.1 Delegation Event Model discussed in an earlier chapter. If you want to use Swing components, 
you must program using the Delegation Event Model. </p>

<p>In some cases, conversion of an application or applet from AWT components to 
Swing components involves nothing more complex than replacing the AWT components 
with corresponding Swing components. For example, the Swing component that 
corresponds to the AWT <b>Button</b> component is the Swing <b>JButton</b>
component. </p>

<p>In all cases that you use Swing you will need to import, or otherwise 
recognize the package that contains the Swing classes so that the compiler and 
interpreter will have access to those classes.</p>

<p>This chapter is designed as a follow-on to the earlier chapter titled <em>Java080 Delegation Event Model, A First Look</em>. As such, 
material presented in that chapter will not be repeated here. </p>

<p>The two AWT sample programs in that chapter were converted to Swing programs 
for presentation in this chapter using the simple substitution procedure 
described above. As you will see, the Swing version of one of the sample 
program behaves essentially the same as its AWT counterpart. The Swing 
version of the other sample program does not behave the same as its AWT 
counterpart. </p>

<p>So, where does that leave us? Well, fortunately, from an event handling 
viewpoint, Swing components operate the same as AWT components <em>(except that 
Swing provides a number of new event types)</em>. From other viewpoints, Swing 
components may or may not behave the same as their AWT counterparts. </p>

<p>In addition, many Swing components don't have an AWT counterpart. A 
number of new components are included in the Swing library that 
don't exist in the AWT <em>(tooltips, progress bars, trees, etc.)</em>. </p>

<p >Since this chapter is primarily concerned with event handling, we 
will pursue the Swing components from an event-handling viewpoint in this chapter 
and leave other considerations surrounding Swing components for later 
chapters. As you will see, this chapter will raise some interesting questions 
regarding the behavior of Swing components, but won't provide the answers to 
those questions.</p>

<h1 ><a name="sample_program"></a>Sample Program</h1>

<p>The sample program in this section, named <a href="#Listing_2">SwingEvent08</a>, was created by 
replacing each instance of <b>Frame</b> in the program named <b>Event08</b>, 
with an instance of <b>JFrame</b>. In addition, an import declaration was 
added to cause the Swing classes to be accessible to the compiler and the 
interpreter.</p>

<p>The event handling in this program is exactly the same as in <b>Event08</b> 
from the earlier chapter. 
If you haven't reviewed that program, and the chapter on the Delegation Event 
Model, you should probably go back and review it now. </p>

<p>This program illustrates the use of <i>Event Sources</i>,<i>
Event Listeners</i>, and <i>Adapters </i>in the <i>Delegation Event Model</i> 
for Swing components. </p>

<p>Briefly, this application instantiates an object that creates a user 
interface consisting of a simple <b>JFrame </b>object. This object is an <i>
Event Source</i> that notifies two different <i>Event Listener</i> objects of <b>
Window </b>events. </p>

<p>One of the <b>Listener </b>objects <i>implements </i>the <b>WindowListener
</b>interface and defines all of the methods declared in that interface. </p>

<p>The other <b>Listener </b>object <i>extends </i>the <b>Adapter
</b>class named <b>WindowAdapter</b>. As explained in the earlier chapter, the 
purpose of <b>Adapter </b>classes <em>(as used in this context)</em> is to implement the <b>
Listener </b>interfaces and to define all of the methods with empty methods.</p>

<p>Classes that <i>extend </i>the <b>Adapter </b>classes can then 
selectively override only those methods of interest. This Listener object 
overrides only two of the methods. </p>

<p>This program was tested using JDK 1.1.6 and Swing 1.0.1 under Win95. <em>
(It was more recently tested using JDK 12.0.1 running under Windows 7.)</em></p>

<p >The output produced by running the program is presented in the 
comments at the beginning of the program listing.</p>

<h2 ><a name="interesting_code_fragments"></a>Interesting Code Fragments</h2>

<p><a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> provides the first and only code fragment, that I am going to show and discuss. 
This fragment shows the 
beginning of the constructor for the <b>GUI</b>
class. The fragment illustrates that this program uses the <b>JFrame</b> class to 
instantiate a top-level container for the graphical user interface instead of a
<strong>Frame</strong> object as in the 
earlier chapter.</p>

<p >If you compile and run this program, you will see that it 
behaves essentially the same as its AWT counterpart named
<b>Event08</b> that was discussed extensively in the 
earlier chapter. </p>

<h2 ><sub><a name="program_listing"></a></sub>Program Listing</h2>

<p>A complete listing of the program is provided in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>.</p>

<h1 ><a name="Another_Sample_Program">Another Sample Program</a></h1>

<p>This is a Swing version of the program named <b>Event09</b> from the 
earlier chapter.</p>

<p>The purpose of this program is to illustrate that in some cases, conversion 
of an AWT program to a Swing program isn't as simple as importing the Swing 
package and replacing the AWT components with their Swing counterparts. </p>

<p>That is what was done with this program. This program is identical to 
the AWT program named <b>Event09</b> except that all instances of <b>Frame</b> 
were replaced by <b>JFrame</b> and the Swing package was imported. </p>

<p>The intended behavior of this program <em>(go back and review </em> <b><em>Event09</em></b><em>
if necessary)</em> is to display the coordinates of the mouse pointer each time the mouse is clicked inside the client area of the
<b>JFrame</b>. </p>

<p>Initially, this program appears to work correctly. As each new click 
occurs on the client area of the <b>JFrame</b>, a new pair of coordinate values 
is displayed. However, the previous pairs of coordinate values does not disappear as 
is the case with the program named <b>Event09</b>. Thus, the behavior is 
significantly different.</p>
<p>It will be left as an exercise for the student to dig into the documentation on Swing in order to understand and explain this 
behavior. </p>

<p>As explained earlier, this chapter is concerned with event handling in Swing 
and this program is adequate to illustrate the use of the Delegation Event Model 
with Swing. I will leave the subtle behavior of the Swing components for 
discussion in future chapters. </p>

<p >If you compile and execute this program, whenever you click the 
mouse inside the <b>JFrame</b>, you should see the coordinates of the mouse 
pointer displayed above the mouse pointer. </p>

<h2 ><a

<p><a href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a> shows the only code fragment that will be highlighted 
for this program in this chapter. 
This fragment illustrates 
how this program extends <b>JFrame</b> into a new class named <b>MyFrame</b> to 
make it possible to override the <b>paint()</b> method of the <b>JFrame</b> 
class. Recall that in the program named <b>Event09</b>, the <b>Frame</b> class 
was extended in a similar way. </p>

<h1 ><a name="summary0">Summary</a></h1>

<p>Swing provides a new set of lightweight components that can be programmed 
using the Delegation Event Model first introduced in JDK 1.1. </p>

<p>In some cases, all that is necessary to convert a program built around AWT 
components to a program built around Swing components is to import the Swing 
classes and replace all instances of AWT components with their Swing 
counterparts. </p>

<p>In other cases, a simple substitution as described above will not produce the 
same behavior. </p>

<p>Many of the Swing components do not have an AWT counterpart. The Swing 
classes contain a number of components that were never added to the AWT 
component library. </p>

<p>This chapter has dealt exclusively with the use of the Delegation Event Model 
for programming Swing components and has left some unanswered questions 
regarding how the behavior of Swing components does, and in some cases does not, 
mirror that of their AWT counterparts. </p>

Rev 05/09/98

This is a Swing version of the program named Event08.

The purpose of this program is to illustrate that in many
respects, programming with Swing components is no different
from programming with AWT components.

Conversion of this program from AWT to Swing involved
nothing more complex than using the search and replace
feature of an editor to replace all instances of Frame
with JFrame and to import the swing package.

Illustrates the use of Event Sources, Event Listeners, and
Adapters in the Delegation Event Model for Swing
components.

Briefly, this application instantiates an object which;
creates a user interface consisting of a simple JFrame;
object.  This object is an Event Source which notifies two
different Event Listener objects of Window events.

One of the Listener objects implements the WindowListener
interface and overrides all of the methods declared in;
that interface.

The other Listener object extends the Adapter class named;
WindowAdapter.  The purpose of Adapter classes is to
implement the  Listener interfaces and to define all of
the methods with empty methods.  Classes which extend the
Adapter classes can then selectively override only those
methods of interest.  This Listener object overrides only
two of the methods.

Note that this application does not terminate and return
control to the operating system.  You must forcefully
terminate it.

Tested using JDK 1.1.6 and Swing 1.0.1 under Win95.

When executed, this application places a simple empty;
JFrame object on the screen.

Starting the program produces screen output similar to
the following:

WProc1 windowActivated test msg
Wproc1 windowOpened test msg

Pressing the minimize button on the JFrame produces the;
output similar to the following:

WProc1 windowIconified test msg
******** WProc2 windowIconified test msg
WProc1 windowDeactivated test msg

Restoring the JFrame after minimization produces the;
output similar to the following:

WProc1 windowActivated test msg
WProc1 windowDeiconified test msg
******** WProc2 windowDeiconified test msg
WProc1 windowActivated test msg

Closing the JFrame by pressing the X-icon in the upper;
right of the JFrame produces output similar to the;
following:

WProc1 windowClosing test msg
WProc1 windowDeactivated test msg
WProc1 windowClosed test msg
