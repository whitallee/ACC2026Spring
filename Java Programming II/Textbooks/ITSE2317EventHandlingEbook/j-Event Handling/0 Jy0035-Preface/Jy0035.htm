<h1>Additional material</h1>
<p>While most of the material required for success in the <strong>Event Handling</strong> portion 
of this course is contained in 
this book, other important material is contained in the section titled <strong>Essence of OOP</strong> in the book for the prerequisite course,
<a href="http://cnx.org/contents/dzOvxPFw">ITSE 2321 - Object-Oriented Programming (Java)</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the following material in the <strong>Essence of OOP</strong> section 
of this book is particularly germane to the <strong>Event Handling</strong> portion of this 
course: </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Java1636 Java OOP: Member Classes</li>
	<li>
	Java1638 Java OOP: Local Classes</li>
	<li>
	Java1640 Java OOP: Anonymous Classes</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(Note in particular that the page titled <strong>Java1640 Java OOP: Anonymous Classes</strong> contains quite a lot of material on 
event handling in addition to the material on anonymous classes. You will need 
to understand the material on anonymous classes as well as the material on event 
handling to succeed in the </em>
	<strong><em>Event Handling</em></strong><em> 
portion of this course.)</em></p>
