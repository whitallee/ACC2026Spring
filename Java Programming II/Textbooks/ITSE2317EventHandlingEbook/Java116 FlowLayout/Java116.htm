<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="preface"></A>Preface</H2>
</FONT><P>Students in Prof. Baldwin's <B><U>Intermediate Java Programming</B></U> classes at ACC are responsible for knowing and understanding all of the material in this chapter. </P>
<P>JDK 1.1 was formally released on February 18, 1997. This chapter was originally written on March 7, 1997 using the software and documentation in the JDK 1.1 download package. It has been updated on various occasions since that time. </P>
<P>The sample programs in this chapter were confirmed to compile and run properly under JDK 1.2 on 2/3/99.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>
</FONT><P>This is one in a series of chapters that concentrate on the package <B>java.awt </B>where most of the functionality exists for providing the user interface to your application or applet. </P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="flowlayout_manager"></A>FlowLayout Manager</H2>
</FONT><P>In earlier chapters, we have learned about absolute positioning and sizing of components in a container and have learned about the <B>BorderLayout</B> manager. </P>
<P>Absolute positioning allows you to place any (reasonable) number of components in a container, but has some problems with cross-platform compatibility. </P>
<P>The <B>BorderLayout</B> manager solves some of the cross-platform compatibility problems, but limits the number of components that can be placed in a container to a maximum of five. In addition, the placement of the components may or may not be suitable for your purposes. </P>
<P>JDK 1.1 provides the <B>FlowLayout</B> manager, which also solves the cross-platform compatibility problems and allows you to place any (reasonable) number of components in a container. In addition, the placement of the components may (or may not) be more suitable for your needs than the <B>BorderLayout</B>. </P>
<B><P>FlowLayout </B>arranges components left to right until no more components fit on the same line. When no more components will fit on a line, a new line is started below the current line. Each line of components can either be <I>centered</I>, <I>left aligned</I>, or <I>right aligned</I> in the container. </P>
<P>If the container is resized by the user at runtime, the locations of the components will be automatically adjusted to place the maximum possible number of components on the first and each successive line. </P>
<P>The <B>FlowLayout</B> class has three <I>Fields</I>, three <I>Constructors</I>, and about a dozen <I>methods</I>. </P>
<P>In most cases, you will probably only be concerned with the <I>Fields </I>and the <I>Constructors </I>unless you need to dynamically modify the layout at runtime. </P>
<P>The three fields are: </P>

<UL>
<B><LI>CENTER -- </B>The center alignment variable. </LI>
<B><LI>LEFT -- </B>The left alignment variable. </LI>
<B><LI>RIGHT -- </B>The right alignment variable.</LI></UL>

<P>The three constructors are: </P>

<UL>
<B><LI>FlowLayout()</B> -- Constructs a new Flow Layout with a centered alignment and a default five-unit horizontal and vertical gap. </LI>
<B><LI>FlowLayout(int)</B> -- Constructs a new Flow Layout with the specified alignment and a default five-unit horizontal and vertical gap. </LI>
<B><LI>FlowLayout(int, int, int)</B> -- Constructs a new Flow Layout with the specified alignment and the specified horizontal and vertical gaps. .</LI></UL>

<P>This chapter contains two sample programs. The first, a "plain vanilla" program, will use the third form of the constructor along with the <B>LEFT</B> alignment variable to construct a <B>FlowLayout</B> object with the components <I>left-aligned</I>, a <U>ten-pixel horizontal gap</U> between components, and a <U>fifteen-pixel vertical gap</U> between components. </P>
<P>The second sample program will make use of one of the methods to adjust the layout dynamically at runtime. </P>
<P>Note that as of 3/7/97, there are some typographical errors in the JDK 1.1 documentation package regarding the <B>FlowLayout</B> class. In particular, the documentation indicates that the class can only be used to layout buttons when in fact, it can be used for any component that is a subclass of <B>Component</B>. </P>
<P>Second, the documentation indicates that the Field <B>CENTER</B> corresponds to the <B>right</B> alignment variable instead of the <B>center</B> alignment variable as it should. </P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="plain_vanilla_sample_program"></A>Plain Vanilla Sample Program</H2>
</FONT><P>The following application, named Layout04, creates a "Plain Vanilla" visual object by placing five non-functional <B>Button </B>objects on a <B>Frame </B>object using the <B>FlowLayout </B>manager.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="discussion_of_first_program"></A>Discussion of First Program</H3>
</FONT><P>The <B>FlowLayout </B>object is constructed with LEFT alignment, a <U>ten-pixel</U> horizontal gap between components, and a <U>fifteen-pixel</U> vertical gap between components. The alignment and the gaps were defined by using the version of the constructor that allows for specification of these parameters. It is also possible to modify these parameters at runtime using methods of the class <B>FlowLayout</B>. </P>
<P>Manually resizing the <B>Frame </B>object at runtime causes the positions of the components to adjust automatically, placing the maximum possible number of components on the first line. </P>

</FONT><P>There isn't much code to be discussed in this program. The first statement creates a new <B>Frame</B> object.

Revised 10/28/97 to better accommodate the width
requirements of the document.

This program is designed to be compiled and run under
JDK 1.1

This program creates a "Plain Vanilla" visual object by
placing five non-functional Button objects on a Frame
object using the FlowLayout manager. The buttons are
non-functional because no event listener objects were
created and registered on the buttons.

The FlowLayout object is constructed with LEFT alignment,
a ten-pixel horizontal gap between components, and a
fifteen-pixel vertical gap between components.

Resizing the Frame object causes the positions of the
components to adjust automatically.

For simplicity, no event listeners were created and
registered. Therefore, the "close" box is not operational
and you will need to use some other method to terminate
the program.

The program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 running under Win95.

Revised 10/28/97 to better accommodate the display width
of the document.

This program is designed to be compiled and run under
JDK 1.1

This program has more substance that the previous one in
this chapter. Although it doesn't do anything particularly
useful, it does illustrate how to modify a flow layout
dynamically at runtime.

Five buttons are added to a frame using a FlowLayout object
as the layout manager with a three-pixel gap between
components in both the horizontal and vertical direction.

An action listener object is instantiated and registered to
listen for action events on all five of the buttons, with
all five buttons sharing the same event handler.

The behavior of the ActionEvent handler is to increase the
spacing between components whenever any of the buttons is
pressed. This is accomplished by increasing the Vgap and
Hgap attributes of the FlowLayout object, setting the
layout manager of the frame to the modified FlowLayout
object, and validating the frame. The validation step is
required in order for the change to become visible.

Repeatedly clicking any of the buttons causes the buttons
to move apart. Eventually they will not all fit on the
frame and they begin to disappear off the edges. They can
be made to reappear by enlarging the frame.

A windowClosing() event listener object is instantiated and
registered on the frame to terminate the program when the
frame is closed.

The program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 running under Win95.

The program starts with a Frame object on the screen with
a size of 280 wide by 100 pixels tall.

Your name must appear in the banner at the top of the
frame.

The frame contains five square buttons with no captions.
The five buttons are in a row across the client area
of the frame with equal separation between the buttons.

The buttons are separated from one another by a gap of
approximately 3 pixels.

When you click on any of the buttons, the gap between
the buttons increases by 5 pixels and the size of every
button is decreased.

As you continue to click on the buttons, the gap continues
to increase by five pixels each click, the buttons
continue to decrease in size, and the horizontal
position of each buttons stay the same. In other words,
the horizontal distance between the centers of the
buttons does not change as the size of the gap between
them increases.

Eventually, the buttons become so small that they disappear.

When you close the frame, the program terminates.

The program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 running under Win95.
