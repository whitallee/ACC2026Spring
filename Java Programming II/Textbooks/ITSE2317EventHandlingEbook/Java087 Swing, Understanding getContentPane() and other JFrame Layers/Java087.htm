<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Previous chapters involving Swing told you that when you add a component to a
<strong>JFrame</strong> object, unlike with the <strong>AWT</strong>, you must 
use statements similar to the following.</p>



<div class="a">
<pre>
myJFrameObject.getContentPane().add(myChildComponent);
</pre>
</div>

<p>As you have probably suspected, there is a lot more to it than just inserting
<strong>getContentPane() </strong>between the object reference and the <strong>
add</strong> method.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to help you understand why you need to call
<strong>getContentPane</strong> or some similar method to add components 
to a <strong>JFrame</strong> object, remove components from a <strong>JFrame</strong> 
object, or set the layout for a <strong>JFrame</strong> object. </p>
<p>Note that this also applies to container objects of type <strong>
JInternalFrame</strong> and <strong>JDialog</strong> as well. </p>
	<h1 class="style1"><a name="General_discussion">General discussion</a></h1>
<p>When programming with the <strong>AWT</strong>, you can place a <strong>Panel</strong> 
object in a <strong>Frame</strong> object and place other components on the
<strong>Panel</strong> object if you wish, or you can simply place other 
components directly on the viewable area of the <strong>Frame</strong> object.</p>

<div class="a">

<p>The viewable area of <strong>Frame</strong> or a <strong>JFrame</strong> is the 
<em>bounds</em> minus the <em>insets</em>. Insets are used to account for the space covered by the borders and the values of the insets on all four sides are available by invoking the method named
<strong>getInsets()</strong> on the object.</p></div>

<p>However, you should not place components directly on the viewable area of a <strong>JFrame</strong> 
object. <em>(This was illustrated by the program named Event09 in the earlier 
chapter titled&nbsp; Java081 Swing and the Delegation Event Model.)</em></p>
<p>An object of type <strong>JRootPane</strong> is automatically placed in the
<strong>JFrame</strong> completely covering the viewable area of the <strong>
JFrame</strong> object. </p>
<p>One way or another, if you want to place components in the <strong>JFrame</strong>, 
you must deal with the <strong>JRootPane</strong> object. </p>
<p>One way to deal with it, and this is the way that you will find recommended 
in many current discussions on the subject, is simply ignore the technical 
details and insert a call to the <strong>getContentPane</strong> method 
between the reference to the <strong>JFrame</strong> and the <strong>add</strong> 
method. </p>
<p>My preference is to first understand why you need to 
do that, and in those cases where that is the appropriate thing to do, go ahead 
and do it. </p>
<p>In those cases where invoking <strong>getContentPane </strong>is not the 
most appropriate thing to do, do the thing that is most appropriate. </p>
<p>Note: You will find much discussion in this chapter about some components 
being on top of other components. These discussions apply only to Swing 
lightweight components. Remember that heavyweight <em>(AWT)</em> components are always on top 
of lightweight <em>(Swing)</em> components regardless of what the text in this chapter may 
say. </p>
	
	<h2><a name="Synopsis">Synopsis</a></h2>
	
	<p><strong>JRootPane</strong> is a container. The instance of <strong>JRootPane</strong> that is automatically placed in a
<strong>JFrame</strong> object contains at least two other objects. </p>
<ul>
	<li>An object of type <strong>JLayeredPane</strong> that we will refer to 
	simply as the <strong><em>layeredPane</em></strong>.</li>
	<li>An object of type <strong>JPanel</strong> that we will refer to simply 
	as the <strong><em>glassPane</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
<p>
There is also an optional <em>menuBar</em> object that comes in here somewhere, but since it is not essential for understanding what is going on at this level, I have elected to defer the discussion until the discussion on Swing menus.</p>
</div>	

<p>The <i>layeredPane</i> and the <i>glassPane</i> also fill 
the viewable area of the <strong>JFrame</strong> object. The <i>glassPane</i> 
is on top of the <i>layeredPane</i>, and as the name might imply, it 
is <em>normally</em> transparent. </p>
<p>Components on the <i>layeredPane</i> are visible through the
<i>glassPane</i>. Mouse events are capable of penetrating the
<i>glassPane</i> and reaching components on the <i>layeredPane</i> 
as long as the <i>glassPane</i> is transparent. </p>
<p>The <i>layeredPane</i> contains another component of type <strong>
JPanel</strong> that we will refer to as the <strong><em>contentPane</em></strong>. 
This is the same pane that we are dealing with when we invoke the <strong>
getContentPane</strong> method on the <strong>JFrame</strong> object. </p>
<p>The <i>layeredPane</i> has a very interesting behavior. </p>
<p>In the same sense that we can add components to the <i>contentPane</i>, 
we can also add components to the <i>layeredPane</i>. </p>
<p>When we add components to the <i>contentPane</i>, they are all 
added at the same layer and components added first are painted on top of 
components added later. </p>
<p>However, when we add components to the <i>layeredPane</i>, we can 
specify the layer number that we want the component to be drawn on. </p>
<p>Components drawn on layers with high <em>(algebraically signed)</em> numbers are 
painted on top of components on layers with smaller <em>(algebraically signed)</em> 
numbers. </p>

<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
<p>
Large negative numbers are smaller than small positive numbers in this case with 
the smallest allowable layer number being -29999.</p>
</div>	

<p>In addition, a variety of methods are available to move components from one 
layer to another at runtime. This gives us the ability to not only control the 
order in which components are painted initially, but also to modify that order 
later at runtime. </p>
<p>This layering concept is a much more powerful approach than simply inserting
<strong>getContentPane</strong> between the reference to the <strong>JFrame</strong> 
object and the invocation of the <strong>add</strong> method.</p>


<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
<p>
Layering has a long history of beneficial results in computer graphics such as 
Computer Aided Design and game programming.</p>
</div>	


<p>So, where does the <i>contentPane</i> object that belongs to the
<i>layeredPane</i> fit into this? </p>
<p>Components on the <i>contentPane</i> are painted behind all 
components that may be added directly to the <i>layeredPane</i>. In 
fact, the layer position for the <i>contentPane</i> is effectively 
layer number -30000. The smallest layer number that can be used to place a 
component directly on a layer is -29999. <em>(We will place one there in our sample 
program later.)</em></p>

<h2><a name="More_detailed_discussion">More detailed discussion</a></h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, a <strong>JRootPane</strong> contains a <em>glassPane</em> <em>(</em><strong><em>JPanel</em></strong><em>) </em>and a <i>layeredPane</i> 
<em>(</em><strong><em>JLayeredPane</em></strong>). The <i>layeredPane</i> contains an 
optional <i>menuBar</i> <em>(<strong>JMenuBar</strong>)</em> and a <i>contentPane</i> <em>(</em><strong><em>JPanel</em></strong>). 
The <i>menuBar</i> component is optional and may or may not exist at any given time. The 
<em>layeredPane</em>, <i>contentPane</i>, and <i>glassPane</i> 
will always be available. </p>
<p>The syntax for dealing with these panes is somewhat different 
from what you are accustomed to. For example, the typical syntax for adding a 
component to a container would look something like the following: </p>

<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
<pre>
parentContainer.add(childObject);
</pre>
</div>	

<p>However, the required syntax for dealing with these panes is more like one of the 
following: </p>

<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
<pre>
myJFrameObject.getContentPane().add(myChildComponent);

myJFrameObject.getLayeredPane().add(
                    myChildComponent, new Integer(5));
</pre>
</div>	

<p>The first statement above adds a component to the <i>contentPane</i>. 
The second statement adds a component to layer number 5 of the <em>layeredPane</em>. </p>
<p>The same concepts apply when removing components, setting layout managers, 
etc. </p>
<p>The <i>contentPane</i> has a <strong>BorderLayout</strong> manager 
by default. The <em>layeredPane</em> has no layout manager <em>(null) </em>by 
default as you will see in the sample program that follows later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>If a <strong>JMenuBar</strong> component is set on the <strong>JRootPane</strong>, 
it is positioned along the upper edge of the frame. The <i>contentPane</i> 
is adjusted in location and size to fill the remaining area. </p>
<p>If you examine the documentation for <strong>JLayeredPane</strong>, you will 
see that the class has the following fields which are all <em>public static final</em>
<strong>Integer</strong> symbolic constants. </p>

<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>DEFAULT_LAYER</strong> - Object defining the Default layer. 
		Equivalent to new Integer(0).</li>
		<li><strong>PALETTE_LAYER</strong> - Object defining the Palette layer. 
		Equivalent to new Integer(100). </li>
		<li><strong>MODAL_LAYER</strong> - Object defining the Modal layer. 
		Equivalent to new Integer(200). </li>
		<li><strong>POPUP_LAYER</strong> - Object defining the Popup layer. 
		Equivalent to new Integer(300). </li>
		<li><strong>DRAG_LAYER</strong> - Object defining the Drag layer. 
		Equivalent to new Integer(400). </li>
		<li><strong>FRAME_CONTENT_LAYER</strong> - Object defining the Frame 
		Content layer. This layer is normally only used to position the <strong>
		contentPane</strong> 
		and menuBar components of <strong>JFrame</strong>. Equivalent to new 
		Integer(-30000).</li>
	</ul>
</div>	

<p>The <strong>JMenuBar</strong> and the <i>contentPane</i> are added 
to the <i>layeredPane</i> component at the following layer (-30000):
</p>
<pre>JLayeredPane.FRAME_CONTENT_LAYER</pre>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the <i>layeredPane</i> object is an instance 
of the <strong>JLayeredPane</strong> class. The purpose of this object is to be 
the parent of all children of the <strong>JRootPane</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, as mentioned earlier, this object provides the ability to add 
components at several layers. This is very useful when working with popup menus, 
dialog boxes, during dragging, or for any other situation in which you might 
want to separate graphic objects onto different layers for display purposes. </p>
<p>Also as indicated earlier, the <i>glassPane</i> is always added as 
the first child of the <strong>JRootPane</strong>. This causes the <strong>
glassPane</strong> to always be on the top of the stack. By default, the <strong>
glassPane</strong> is not visible and is transparent. Thus, mouse events can 
normally penetrate the <i>glassPane</i> and impinge upon the 
components below it. </p>
<p>It is theoretically possible to draw components on the <i>glassPane</i> <em>(although I haven't been able to purposely do it as of 5/12/98).</em> When this is 
done, those components shadow the components below them preventing mouse events 
from impinging on the components down below. </p>
<p>Components drawn on the <i>glassPane</i> will always be above all 
other lightweight components in the stacking order of components <em>(but not over 
top of heavyweight components).</em> Thus, the <i>glassPane</i> can be used 
to assure that such components as popup menus and tool tips are always on top of 
the other components on the screen. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, by default, the <i>glassPane</i> is not 
visible. Developers should use setVisible on the <i>glassPane</i> to 
control when the <i>glassPane</i> displays over the other children.
</p>
<p>The layout manager used by <strong>JRootPane</strong> insures that 
the following is true: </p>
<!--Set border to 15 to create a note. Paragraph elements inside the note are allowed but not required.-->
<div class="a">
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>glassPane</strong>, if present, fills the entire 
		viewable area of the <strong>JRootPane</strong> (bounds - insets).</li>
		<li>The <strong>layeredPane</strong> fills the entire viewable area of 
		the <strong>JRootPane</strong>. (bounds - insets)</li>
		<li>The <strong>menuBar</strong> is positioned at the upper edge of the
		<strong>layeredPane</strong>().</li>
		<li>The <strong>contentPane</strong> fills the entire viewable area, 
		minus the <strong>MenuBar</strong>, if present.</li>
	</ul>
</div>	

<p>If you replace the layout manager of the <strong>JRootPane</strong> with a different layout manager, 
you are responsible for managing all of those views. </p>
<p>So now we know that the <strong>JRootPane</strong> object contains an object 
of type <strong>JLayeredPane</strong>. While <strong>JLayeredPane</strong> manages it's list of children like
a
<strong>Container</strong>, it also allows for the definition of several 
layers within itself. </p>
<p>Children in the same layer are managed exactly like the normal <strong>
Container</strong> object. However, children in higher layers display above the 
children in lower layers. Each layer has a distinct integer number. </p>
<p>Apparently each Swing <strong>Component</strong> has a layer attribute <em>(but I 
haven't been able to find out anything about it other than as described below).
</em>
</p>
<p>There are at least three ways to set the layer attribute on a <strong>
Component</strong>: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Passing an Integer object with a literal integer value during the add 
call: <strong>layeredPane.add(child,new Integer(10));</strong></li>
	<li>Passing one of the symbolic constants mentioned earlier during the add 
call: <strong>layeredPane.add(child,JLayeredPane.DEFAULT_LAYER)</strong></li>
	<li>Calling the following set method on the <strong>JLayeredPane</strong> that 
will be the parent of the component and passing the name of the component and an
	<strong>int</strong> that specifies the layer number:
<strong>layeredPaneParent.setLayer(child,10)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this third case, the 
layer should be set before adding the child to the parent. </p>
<p>Layers with higher numbers display on top of layers with lower numbers. </p>
<p>Higher and lower in this case includes the algebraic sign of the layer. For 
example, a large negative number is a lower layer than a small positive number.
</p>
<p>These layers are simply a logical construct and layout managers 
will affect all child components without regard for layer settings. Therefore, 
to take advantage of this layering capability, you may need to design your own 
layout manager or use absolute layout <em>(null layout manager)</em>. </p>
<p>We will see some examples in the sample program that follows. </p>
<h1><a name="Sample_program">Sample program</a></h1>
<p>The primary purpose of this program is to illustrate the use of both the
<i>contentPane</i> and the <i>layeredPane</i>. </p>
<p>The program places a <strong>JFrame</strong> object on the screen as the 
primary GUI as shown in <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1.</a></p>




<div class="a">
	<p>

<p>
<img alt="See a description of this image in the text before and after the image." height="201" src="swingpane01a.jpg" width="301"/>
</p>
</div>

<p>A red <strong>JTextField</strong> object and a white <strong>JLabel</strong> object are placed on 
the <i>contentPane</i> on the <strong>JFrame</strong> object. The
<strong>JTextField</strong> object is placed in the <em>Center</em> of the <strong>JFrame</strong> 
using the default border layout. The <strong>JLabel</strong> is placed in the 
<em>South</em> position on the <strong>JFrame</strong> object. </p>
<p>A green <strong>JButton</strong> object and a yellow <strong>JButton</strong> object are 
placed on the <i>layeredPane</i>. Apparently the default layout for 
the <i>layeredPane</i> is absolute or null. The <strong>JButton</strong> 
objects are purposely placed so as to partially overlap. Both buttons appear on 
top of the red <strong>JTextField</strong> object on the <i>contentPane</i>. 
<em>(Components on layered panes are always on top of components on the </em> <strong>
<em>contentPane</em></strong><em>).</em> </p>
<p>The green <strong>JButton</strong> is initially placed at layer position +1 
on the layered pane and the yellow <strong>JButton</strong> is initially placed 
at layer position -29999 which is the limit in the negative direction. </p>
<p>Action listeners are registered on the two buttons. When the top <em>(green)</em> button is 
clicked, the action is to swap the layer positions of the two buttons causing 
the yellow button to move to the top as shown in <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>. </p>

<p><img alt="See a description of this image in the text before and after the image." height="201" src="swingpane01b.jpg" width="301"/></p></div>

<p>The program was originally tested using JDK 1.1.6 and Swing 1.0.1 under Windows 95. 
More recently it was tested using Java 12.0.1 under Windows 7.</p>
<p>Several lines of code are included in the program to investigate the parent child 
relationships of the various panes. The text output from this part of the 
program, when run using Java 8, is shown in <a href="#Figure_3">Figure 3</a>.</p>

<p>The JavaSoft documentation indicates that the <i>contentPane</i> is 
placed at an equivalent layer position of -30000 in the <i>layeredPane</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i>glassPane</i> is something of a mystery to me at this point 
in time (5/12/98). I was unable to draw on the <i>glassPane</i>. An 
attempt to place either a <strong>JButton</strong> object or a <strong>JToolTip</strong> 
object on the <i>glassPane</i> was rejected by the compiler with error 
messages that the <strong>JButton</strong> and the <strong>JToolTip</strong> 
could not be converted to type <strong>JPopupMenu</strong>. I don't know if this 
is proper behavior or a bug. </p>

<p>This code is all pretty intuitive. You should be able to 
surmise what it is doing simply from the names of the methods being invoked. </p>
<p><a href="#Listing_5">Listing 5</a> instantiates a <strong>JLabel</strong> object and a <strong>
JTextField</strong> object and places them on the <i>contentPane</i>. 
</p>

<div class="a">

	</p>
<pre>
    JLabel theLabel = new JLabel(
         "  Click buttons to swap their layer positions.");
    this.getContentPane().add(theLabel,"South");
    
    //Put a red JTextField in the Center of the JFrame on
    // the content pane.
    JTextField redTextField = new JTextField(
                        "    redTextField on contentPane");
    redTextField.setBackground(Color.red);
    this.getContentPane().add(redTextField,"Center");
</pre>
</div>
<p>The default layout manager for the <i>contentPane</i> is <strong>
BorderLayout</strong>. This code places the red <strong>JTextField</strong> in 
the <strong>Center</strong> position of the <i>contentPane</i> and 
places the <strong>JLabel</strong> in the <strong>South</strong> position.</p>
<p><em>(For the metal Look and Feel, the </em> <strong><em>JLabel </em> </strong>
<em>appears to be part of the border at the bottom of the </em> <strong><em>JFrame</em></strong><em> 
object as shown in </em> <a href="#Figure_2"><em>Figure 2</em></a><em>.)</em></p>
<p>The <em>South</em> <strong>JLabel</strong> provides instructions regarding 
the use of the <strong>JButton</strong> objects that will also be placed on the
<strong>JFrame</strong> object. </p>
<p><a href="#Listing_6">Listing 6</a> instantiates a green <strong>JButton</strong> object and 
places it on the <i>layeredPane</i> at layer number one (1). </p>

    greenButton.setBackground(Color.green);
    greenButton.setBounds(10,10,240,40);
    greenButton.addActionListener(new MyActionListener());
    theLayeredPane.add(greenButton,new Integer(1));
</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that 
the <strong>setBounds</strong> method is used to establish the location and 
size of the button in absolute pixel coordinates. Recall that I said earlier 
that apparently the default layout manager for the <i>layeredPane</i> 
is null. Otherwise, it would have been necessary for me to set it to null before 
placing this object on an absolute location and size basis. </p>
<p>Also note that an <strong>ActionListener</strong> object is registered on the <strong>
JButton</strong> object. We will see the class that defines the behavior of the 
listener object later. </p>
<p><a href="#Listing_7">Listing 7</a> instantiates a yellow <strong>JButton</strong> object and places it on 
the <i>layeredPane</i> at layer number -29999. This is the bottom-most 
layer of all programmable layers in the <i>layeredPane</i>. The <strong>

</div>
<p>This is a 
standard listener class that defines the <strong>actionPerformed</strong> 
method. </p>
<p>The behavior of the <strong>actionPerformed</strong> method in this case is 
to cause the layer positions of the two <strong>JButton</strong> objects to be 
swapped whenever the button on top is clicked. This causes the <strong>JButton</strong> 
object immediately below the one on the top to move to the top of the stack. </p>
<p>Note that this method invokes the <strong>setLayer</strong> method of the
<strong>JLayeredPane</strong> class to rearrange the positions of the two
<strong>JButton</strong> objects at runtime. </p>

Updated 7/10/16 for Java 8 compatibility.

Revised 1/12/99 for JDK 1.2 Swing compatibility

The purpose of this program is to illustrate the use of
the content pane and the layered pane.

The program places a JFrame object on the screen as the
primary GUI.

A red JTextField and a white JLabel are placed on the 
content pane on the JFrame object.  (The white label is
actually rendered as gray in the metal L&amp;F.)
  
The JTextField is placed in the Center of the JFrame using
the default border layout.  The JLabel is placed in the
South position on the JFrame object.

A green JButton and a yellow JButton are placed on the
layered pane of the JFrame object.  Apparently the default
layout for the layered pane is absolute or null.  The 
JButton objects are purposely placed so as to partially
overlap.  Both buttons appear on top of the JTextField
object on the content pane.

The green JButton is initially placed at layer position +1
on the layered pane and the yellow JButton is initially 
placed at layer position -29999 which is the limit in the 
negative direction.

Action listeners are registered on the two buttons.  When
the top button is clicked, the action is to swap the layer
positions of the two buttons causing the other one to
move to the top layer position.

Several lines of code are included to investigate the
parent child relationships of the various panes.  The
output from this part of the program follows.  Note that
line breaks were manually inserted here to force the
material to fit in this format.


Root pane is: class com.sun.java.swing.JRootPane
Parent of root pane is SwingPane01
     [frame0,0,0,0x0,invalid,hidden,
     layout=java.awt.BorderLayout,resizable,title=]

Glass pane is: class com.sun.java.swing.JPanel
Parent of glass pane is com.sun.java.swing.JRootPane
     [,0,0,0x0,invalid,
     layout=com.sun.java.swing.JRootPane$RootLayout]

Layered pane is: class com.sun.java.swing.JLayeredPane
Parent of layered pane is com.sun.java.swing.JRootPane
     [,0,0,0x0,invalid,
     layout=com.sun.java.swing.JRootPane$RootLayout]

Content pane is: class com.sun.java.swing.JPanel
Parent of content pane is com.sun.java.swing.JLayeredPane
     [null.layeredPane,0,0,0x0,invalid]

An interpretation of the above is:
  The root pane is a child of the JFrame object.
  The glass page is a child of the root pane.
  The layered pane is a child of the root pane.
  The content pane is a child of the layered pane.
  
  The root pane is of type JRootPane.
  The glass pane is of type JPanel.
  The layered pane is of type JLayeredPane.
  The content pane is of type JPanel.
  
The JavaSoft documentation indicates that the content pane
is placed at layer position -30000 in the layered pane.

The glass pane is something of a mystery at this point.
I was unable to draw upon the glass pane.  An attempt to 
place either a JButton object or a JToolTip object on the
glass plane was rejected by the compiler with error
messages that the JButton and the JToolTip could not be
converted to type JPopupMenu.

Tested using JDK 1.1.6 and Swing 1.0.1 under Win95.
