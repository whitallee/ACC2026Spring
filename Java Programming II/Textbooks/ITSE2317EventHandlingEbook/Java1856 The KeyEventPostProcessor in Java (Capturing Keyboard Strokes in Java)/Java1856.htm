<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The focus subsystem</b></font></p>
<p>When Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition Version 1.4 
was released, it contained a large number of new features. This included many changes and additions to 
the focus subsystem, some of which were incompatible with earlier versions.</p>
<p>This chapter is part of a series of chapters designed to 
teach you how to use some of those features of the focus subsystem.</p>
<p>The first chapter in the series was entitled 
<a href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/2198221">Focus 
Traversal Policies in Java Version 1.4</a>. The previous chapter was 
entitled <a href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3452231">The 
KeyEventDispatcher in Java</a>.</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Previous topics</b></font></p>
<p>Previous chapters in this series have taught you how to use several features of the new focus subsystem, 
including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Defining new focus traversal keys</li>
	<li>How to control focusability at runtime.</li>
	<li>The ability to query for the currently focused Component.</li>
	<li>The default Focus Traversal Policy.</li>
	<li>How to establish a focus traversal policy and modify it at runtime.</li>
	<li>How to control the focus programmatically.</li>
	<li>Opposite components.</li>
	<li>The KeyEventDispatcher.</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter will show you how to use the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> interface.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Builds on previous chapter</b></font></p>
<p>The sample program that I will explain in this chapter is an upgrade of the 
program presented in the previous chapter entitled 
<a href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3452231">The 
KeyEventDispatcher in Java</a>. Thus, the 
material in this chapter builds upon the material that I presented in that 
chapter. As a result, much of the material discussed early in this chapter 
will be very brief, simply reminding you of what you learned in the previous 
chapter.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you study and understand the material in the 
previous chapter entitled
<a href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3452231">The 
KeyEventDispatcher in Java</a> before embarking on the material in this chapter.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What do we mean by focus?</b></font></p>
<p>Among all of the applications showing on the desktop at any point in time, 
only one will respond to the keyboard.</p>
<p>If that application is a Java application, only one component 
within that application's graphical user interface <i>(GUI)</i> will respond to 
the keyboard. That is the component that has the <i>focus</i> at that 
point in time.</p>
<p>A Java component that has the focus also has the ability to fire <b>KeyEvents</b> when it responds to the keyboard.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>KeyEventDispatcher and KeyEventPostProcessor</b></font></p>
<p>The program that I will explain in this chapter makes heavy use of both the <b>
KeyEventDispatcher</b> interface and the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> interface.</p>
<p>The previous chapter provided detailed information about the <b>
KeyEventDispatcher</b> interface, so I won't repeat that information here. 
Rather, I will concentrate on the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> interface in this 
chapter.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What does Sun have to say?</b></font></p>
<p>Before getting into the technical details, I will provide some 
quotations from Sun that describe both the<b> KeyEventDispatcher</b> interface 
and<b> KeyEventPostProcessor</b> interface.</p>
<p><i>&quot;A <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> is a lightweight interface that allows client 
code to pre-listen to all <b>KeyEvents</b> ...</i></p>
<p><i>... allowing the <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> to retarget the event, consume 
it, dispatch it itself, or make other changes.</i></p>
<p><i>... if a <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> reports that it dispatched the 
KeyEvent, ... the <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> will take no further action with 
regard to the KeyEvent.</i></p>
<p><i>Client-code may also post-listen to <b>KeyEvents</b> ...using the <b>
KeyEventPostProcessor</b> interface. </i></p>
<p><i><b>KeyEventPostProcessors</b> registered with the current <b>
KeyboardFocusManager</b> will receive <b>KeyEvents</b> after the <b>KeyEvents</b> 
have been dispatched to and handled by the focus owner.&quot;</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>In layman's terms ...</b></font></p>
<p>A <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> object has an opportunity to process all <b>
KeyEvents</b> before they are dispatched to the components that fired them, and 
can prevent those events from being dispatched to the components that fired them.</p>
<p>A <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> object has an opportunity to process all <b>
KeyEvents</b> after they have been processed by <b>KeyEventDispatchers</b> 
or by the components that fired the events.</p>

<p>You may find it useful to open another copy of this chapter in a separate
 browser window. That will make it easier for you to scroll back and
 forth among the different figures and listings while you are reading about
 them. </p>

<p>In this chapter, I will show you how to use a <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> to process <b>KeyEvents</b> 
after they have been processed by <b>
KeyEventDispatchers</b> or by the components that fired the events.</p>
<p>Using a sample program, characters typed into one text field in a GUI will 
appear in another text field belonging to the same GUI. Those characters 
will not appear in the text field into which they were typed.</p>
<p>In addition, a <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> will display information about 
the events on the screen.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Discussion_and_Sample_Code">Discussion and Sample 
Code</a></h2>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Description of the program</b></font></p>
<p>This chapter presents and explains a sample program named <b>
KeyEventPostProc01</b>.</p>
<p>This program illustrates the use of a <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> object in 
addition to a pair of <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects.</p>
<p>This program is an upgrade of the program named <b>KeyEventDispatch01</b>, 
which was discussed in the previous chapter. This version adds a <b>
KeyEventPostProcessor</b> to process <b>KeyEvents</b> after they have been 
handled either by the focus owner or by a <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> object.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The program GUI</b></font></p>
<p>The program causes a single <b>JFrame</b> object to appear on the screen as 
shown in Figure 1.</p>
<div align="center">
<div class="a">                    
<pre><img border="0" src="java1856a.gif" width="391" height="101">

<b>Figure 1 Program GUI.</b>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>JFrame</b> object contains three <b>JTextField</b> objects. The initial text in 
the three <b>JTextField</b> objects is respectively: 
 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Field A 
	</li>
	<li>Field B 
	</li>
	<li>Field C </li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Two KeyEventDispatcher objects</b></font></p>
<p>Two different <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects are 
registered on the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> 
in the following order:</p>
<ul>
	<li>AlternateDispatcherA </li>
	<li>AlternateDispatcherB </li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>When a KeyEvent occurs ...</b></font></p>
<p>When a <b>KeyEvent</b> occurs, the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> delivers that event to 
the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> object for dispatching. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Events are delivered to multiple registered <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects in the 
order in which they are registered.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>If the focus owner is <i>Field A ...</i></b></font></p>
<p>If the 
owner of the focus at that point in time <i>(the source of the event)</i> is 
<i>Field A,</i> the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> object 
<i>re-dispatches</i> that event to <i>Field C</i> and returns 
<b>false</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Note that the program in the previous chapter returned <b>true</b> at 
	this point.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Re-dispatching the event to<i> Field C </i>causes keystrokes entered into <i>Field A</i> to appear in <i>Field C</i> instead 
of appearing in <i>Field A.</i> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>If the source of the event is not <i>Field A ...</i></b></font></p>
<p>If the source of the event is not <i>Field A,</i> the <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> 
object still returns <b>false</b>. The object returns <b>false</b> 
regardless of whether the source of the event is <i>Field A.</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Returning false ...</b></font></p>
<p>Returning <b>false</b> causes the event to be delivered to <b>
AlternateDispatcherB</b> as described below, and also causes the event to be 
delivered to the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> later.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>If the source of the event is <i>Field B ...</i></b></font></p>
<p>If the 
owner of the focus at that point in time is 
<i>Field B, </i>the <b>AlternateDispatcherB</b> object 
<i>re-dispatches </i>that event to <i>Field C</i> and returns 
<b>false</b>. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Once again, the program in the previous chapter returned <b>true</b> 
	at this point.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Re-dispatching the event to<i> Field C </i>causes keystrokes entered into 
<i>Field B</i> to appear in <i>Field C</i> instead of appearing in <i>Field B.</i> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>If the source of the event is not <i>Field B ...</i></b></font></p>
<p>If the owner of the focus at that point in time 
is not <i>Field B,</i> the <b>AlternateDispatcherB</b> object 
still returns <b>false</b>.</p>
<p>Returning<b> false </b>causes the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> to dispatch the event to 
the component that owns the focus. This is what normally happens in the absence 
of registered <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects.</p>
<p>Returning <b>false</b> also causes the event to be delivered to the <b>
KeyEventPostProcessor</b> later.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Must be <i>Field C</i> </b></font> </p>
<p>In this 
program, the component that owns the focus at this point would have to be <i>Field C</i> 
because it has already been determined that 
neither <i>Field A</i> nor <i>Field B</i> owns the focus. 
 
This causes keystrokes entered into <i>Field C</i> to 
appear in <i>Field C</i> as normal.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>All keystrokes appear in <i>Field C</i></b></font></p>
<p>Thus, all keystrokes typed into any of the 
three fields in the GUI in Figure 1 will appear in <i>Field C.</i> 
 
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The state of the GUI</b></font></p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the state of the GUI after the characters a, b, and c, were entered respectively into fields A, B, and C, in that order. Note 
that all three characters, abc, appear in <i>Field C.</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The KeyEventPostProcessor</b></font></p>
<p>After the event has been dispatched to the focus owner or delivered to the <b>
KeyEventDispatcher</b> objects, the <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b> will deliver the 
event to the registered <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> objects for final 
processing.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(There is only one registered <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> in this 
	program.)</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Display the character and the event type</b></font></p>
<p>The <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> determines and displays the character that 
was entered into the text field and the type of the event. Three types of
<b>KeyEvent</b> are possible:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The &quot;key pressed&quot; event.</li>
	<li>The &quot;key released&quot; event.</li>
	<li>The &quot;key typed&quot; event.</li>
</ul>
<p>The character and the type of the event are displayed on the screen as each 
event is processed by the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Note that typing a single character into a text field causes all three 
	of the event types listed above to be fired.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The screen output</b></font></p>
<p>The screen output produced by entering the characters a, b, and c into fields 
A, B, and C respectively is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<div align="center">
<div class="a">

<b>Figure 2</b></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>A chain of KeyEventPostProcessors</b></font></p>
<p>A <b>KeyboardFocusManager </b>can register more than one <b>
KeyEventPostProcessors</b>, creating a chain of <b>KeyEventPostProcessors</b>, 
ending with the current <b>KeyboardFocusManager</b>.</p>
<p>Each <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> can return either <b>true</b> or <b>
false</b>. If a <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> returns false, then the <b>KeyEvent</b> is 
passed to the next <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> in the chain.</p>
<p>If the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> returns <b>true, </b>the <b>KeyEvent</b> 
is assumed to have been fully handled and the <b>KeyboardFocusManager </b>will 
take no further action with regard to the <b>KeyEvent</b>.</p>
<p>Note that the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> in this program returns <b>true</b>. 
However, it doesn't matter whether the return value is <b>true</b> or <b>false</b> 
because only one <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> is registered on the <b>
KeyboardFocusManager</b> in this program. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Will discuss the program in fragments</b></font></p>
<p>I will discuss this program in fragments. A complete listing of the 
program is provided in Listing 7 near the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>Listing 1 shows the class named <b>KeyEventPostProc01</b>, including 
the <b>main</b> method.</p>
<div class="a">                     
<pre>
class <b>KeyEventPostProc01</b>{
  public static void <b>main</b>(String[] args){
    new GUI();
  }//end main
}//end class KeyEventPostProc01

<b>Listing 1</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>In this case, the <b>main</b> method simply instantiates an object of the <b>
GUI</b> class. The object of the <b>GUI</b> class appears in Figure 1.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The GUI class</b></font></p>
<p>Listing 2 shows the beginning of the <b>GUI</b> class, which extends the <b>
JFrame</b> class. Thus, a <b>GUI</b> object is also a <b>JFrame</b> 
object.</p>
<div class="a">

class GUI extends JFrame{
  JTextField fieldA =
                    new JTextField("Field A",12);

    setVisible(true);
    manager = KeyboardFocusManager.
                getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager();

    manager.addKeyEventDispatcher(
                        new AlternateDispatcherA(

    manager.addKeyEventDispatcher(
                        new AlternateDispatcherB(
                         fieldB,fieldC,manager));

<b>Listing 2</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>The code in Listing 2 is very similar to the code that I explained in the 
previous chapter, so I won't repeat that explanation here.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(Note that the code in Listing 2 ends in the middle of the 
	constructor.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Register a KeyEventPostProcessor</b></font></p>

<b>Listing 3</b>

</div></p>
<p>The statement in Listing 3 instantiates a new object of the <b>PostProcessor</b>

<p>The <b>PostProcessor</b> class implements the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> 
interface. Therefore, an object of the <b>PostProcessor</b> class is a <b>

<blockquote>
	<p><i>(I will explain the <b>PostProcessor</b> class later in this chapter.)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>End of the GUI class</b></font></p>
<p>Listing 3 also signals the end of the constructor and the end of the <b>GUI</b>

<b>Listing 4</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>The <b>AlternateDispatcherA</b> class implements the <b>KeyEventDispatcher</b>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Similar to previous code</b></font></p>
<p>The code in Listing 4 is almost identical to code in a class having the same

some minor logic changes having to do with the return value from the method 
named <b>dispatchKeyEvent</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>(This version of the <b>dispatchKeyEvent</b> method always returns <b>

<p>Therefore, I won't repeat that explanation in this chapter.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The AlternateDispatcherB class</b></font></p>
<p>Listing 7 near the end of the chapter also defines a class named <b>

<p>As a result, I won't show the <b>AlternateDispatcherB </b>class as a code 
fragment in this chapter, and I won't repeat the previous explanation in this chapter.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The PostProcessor class</b></font></p>
<p>The beginning of the <b>PostProcessor</b> class and the entire method named

<b>Listing 5</b>
</pre>
</div></p>
<p>The <b>PostProcessor</b> class implements the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> 
interface. Therefore, an object of the <b>PostProcessor</b> class is a <b>

<p>An object of the <b>PostProcessor</b> class was registered on the <b>
KeyboardFocusManager</b> in Listing 3 by invoking the <b>

passing the <b>PostProcessor</b> object as a parameter.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The addKeyEventPostProcessor method</b></font></p>
<p>Here is some of what Sun has to say about the behavior of the <b>

<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;This method adds a <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> to this <b>
	KeyboardFocusManager's</b> post- processor chain. </i></p>
	<p><i>After a <b>KeyEvent</b> has been dispatched to and handled by its

	KeyEventPostProcessor</b> perform any necessary post-processing as part of 
	the <b>KeyEvent's</b> final resolution. </i></p>
	<p><i><b>KeyEventPostProcessors</b> will be notified in the order in which

	<p><i>Notifications will halt as soon as one KeyEventPostProcessor returns
	<b>true</b> from its <b>postProcessKeyEvent</b> method. </i></p>
	<p><i>There is no limit to the <span lang="en-us"></span>total number of <b>KeyEventPostProcessors</b> 
	that can be added, nor to the number of times that a particular <b>

	<p><i>If a null post-processor is specified, no action is taken and no 
	exception is thrown.&quot;</i> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The KeyEventPostProcessor interface</b></font></p>
<p>The <b>PostProcessor</b> class implements the <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> 
interface. Here is some of what Sun has to say about that interface.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;A <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> cooperates with the current <b>

</blockquote>
<p>The <b>KeyEventPostProcessor</b> interface declares a single method named <b>

interface.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The postProcessKeyEvent method</b></font></p>
<p>Here is some of what Sun has to say about the <b>postProcessKeyEvent</b>

<p>The code invokes the following two methods on the <b>KeyEvent</b> object:</p>
<ul>
	<li>getKeyChar</li>
	<li>getID</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Behavior of these methods</b></font></p>
<p>The <b>getKeyChar</b> method returns the character associated with the key in 
the <b>KeyEvent</b> object.</p>
<p>The <b>getID</b> method is inherited from the <b>AWTEvent</b> class. It 
returns the event type as a numeric value. For a <b>KeyEvent</b>,<b> t</b>he 
event type is returned as a value of type <b>int</b>, which corresponds to one 
of the following three constants defined in the <b>KeyEvent</b> class:</p>
<ul>
	<li>KEY_PRESSED</li>
	<li>KEY_RELEASED</li>
	<li>KEY_TYPED</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Event type as a descriptive String</b></font></p>
<p>The purpose of the code in Listing 5 is to display the character and the 
event type for all <b>KeyEvents</b>.</p>
<p>Because the <b>getID</b> method returns the type as a numeric value of type
<b>int</b>, it is useful to convert that type to a descriptive string before 
displaying it. This is accomplished by the method named <b>getEventType.</b></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The getEventType method</b></font></p>
<p>The <b>getEventType</b> method is shown in Listing 6.</p>
<div class="a">

String getEventType(int ID){
  if(ID == KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED){
    return "keyPressed";
  }else if(ID == KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED){
    return "keyReleased";
  }else if(ID == KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED){
    return "keyTyped";
  }else{
    return "Unknown event type";
  }//end else
}//end getEventType

<b>Listing 6</b>

<p>This method simply</p>
<ul>
	<li>Receives the numeric type identifier as an incoming parameter.</li>

Copyright,R.G.Baldwin
Revised 07/27/04

This program illustrates the use of a
KeyEventPostProcessor in addition to an
alternate KeyEventDispatcher.

This is an upgrade to the program named
KeyEventDispatch01. This version adds a
KeyEventPostProcessor to process key events after
they have been handled either by the focus owner
or by an alternate KeyEventDispatcher object.

A JFrame object appears on the screen containing
three JTextField objects. The initial text in
the three JTextField objects is respectively:

Field A
Field B
Field C

Two alternative KeyEventDispatcher objects are
registered on the current KeyboardFocusManager
in the following order:

AlternateDispatcherA
AlternateDispatcherB

In addition a KeyEventPostProcessor object is
registered on the current KeyboardFocusManager.

When a key event occurs, the current
KeyboardFocusManager delivers that event to
AlternateDispatcherA for dispatching. If the
owner of the focus at that point in time is
Field A, the AlternateDispatcherA object
re-dispatches that event to Field C and returns
false. That causes keystrokes entered into
Field A to appear in Field C instead. Returning
false causes the event to be delivered to
AlternateDispatcherB as described below, and also
causes the event to be delivered to the
KeyEventPostProcessor later.

If the owner of the focus at that point in time
is not Field A, the AlternateDispatcherA object
returns false. This causes the current
KeyboardFocusManager to deliver the event to
AlternateDispatcherB for dispatching. If the
owner of the focus at that point in time is
Field B, the AlternateDispatcherB object
re-dispatches that event to Field C and returns
false. That causes keystrokes entered into
Field B to appear in Field C instead. Returning
false causes the event to be delivered to the
KeyEventPostProcessor later.

If the owner of the focus at that point in time
is not Field B, the AlternateDispatcherB object
returns false. This causes the current
KeyboardFocusManager to dispatch the event to
the component that owns the focus. In this
simple program, that would have to be Field C
because it has already been determined that
neither Field A nor Field B own the focus.

That causes keystrokes entered into Field C to
appear in Field C as is normally the case.

Thus, all keystrokes entered into any of the
three fields in the GUI will appear in field C.

In addition, after the event has been dispatched
to the focus owner or delivered to the alternate
KeyEventDispatcher object, the
KeyboardFocusManager will deliver the event to
the KeyEventPostProcessor object for final
processing. The KeyEventPostProcessor determines
and displays the character that was entered into
the text field and the type of the event. Three
types of event are possible:

The &quot;key pressed&quot; event.
The &quot;key released&quot; event.
The &quot;key typed&quot; event.

The character and the type of the event are
displayed on the screen as each event is
processed by the KeyEventPostProcessor. Note
that entering a single character into a text
field causes all three of the event types listed
above to be fired. The screen output produced
by entering the characters a, b, and c into
fields A, B, and C respectively is shown below.

a keyPressed
a keyTyped
a keyReleased
b keyPressed
b keyTyped
b keyReleased
c keyPressed
c keyTyped
c keyReleased

Note that the KeyEventPostProcessor returns true,
but in this program, it doesn't matter whether
the return value is true or false. This is
because this program only has one
KeyEventPostProcessor object registered on the
KeyboardFocusManager. If a KeyEventPostProcessor
object returns false, then the KeyEvent is passed
to the next KeyEventPostProcessor in the chain,
ending with the current KeyboardFocusManager. If
true, the KeyEvent is assumed to have been fully
handled (although this need not be the case), and
the AWT will take no further action with regard
to the KeyEvent.
