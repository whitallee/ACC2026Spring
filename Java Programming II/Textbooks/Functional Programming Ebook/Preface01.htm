    <p>Welcome to functional programming! In this eBook, we will 
	delve into the realm of functional programming, exploring its 
	principles, benefits, and challenges. We will also take a closer look at 
	essential concepts such as streams, default methods, method references, 
	functional interfaces, and lambda expressions.</p>
	<p>Functional programming has gained significant popularity in recent years 
	due to its ability to simplify code, promote modularity, and enhance 
	concurrency. By emphasizing immutability, higher-order functions, and 
	declarative programming, functional programming offers a fresh perspective 
	on software development, empowering developers to write cleaner, more 
	concise, and easier-to-maintain code.</p>
	<p>In the first section of this eBook, we will explore the foundational 
	principles of functional programming. We will delve into the core ideas that 
	distinguish functional programming from other programming paradigms, such as 
	imperative or object-oriented programming. By understanding these 
	principles, you will be equipped with a solid foundation to grasp the 
	subsequent topics in this eBook.</p>
	<p>The next section of the eBook will introduce you to streams, default 
	methods, and method references in the context of functional programming. 
	Streams provide a powerful abstraction for processing sequences of data in a 
	declarative and composable manner. Default methods enable the addition of 
	new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations, 
	facilitating better code reuse. Method references provide a concise syntax 
	for referring to existing methods, allowing for greater expressiveness and 
	readability.</p>
	<p>Functional interfaces form an essential building block of functional 
	programming in Java. They serve as the foundation for using lambda 
	expressions and enable the representation of functions as objects.</p>
	<p>Lastly, we will explore one of the most significant features of Java 8 
	and beyond: lambda expressions. Lambda expressions offer a concise and 
	powerful syntax for representing anonymous functions. With lambda 
	expressions, you can write more expressive code and pass behavior as data, 
	opening up new possibilities for abstraction and composition.</p>
	<p>Throughout this eBook, we will not only explain the concepts and syntax 
	of functional programming in Java but also provide practical examples and 
	code snippets that will help you grasp the concepts and apply them in your 
	own projects.</p>
