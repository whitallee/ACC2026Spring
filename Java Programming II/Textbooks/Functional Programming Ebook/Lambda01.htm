	<h2><a name="Preface">Preface</a></h2>
	<p>This lesson explores the concept of lambda expressions, which are 
	anonymous functions or function literals commonly used in programming 
	languages that support functional programming paradigms. The discussion 
	contrasts lambda expressions in two popular programming languages: Python 
	and Java.</p>
<p>In the general section, the lesson explains how lambda functions are utilized 
as one-line functions that don't require a separate def statement in Python 
code. It outlines the structure of a lambda expression and provides an example 
to illustrate its usage. The benefits of lambda expressions in Python, such as 
conciseness and suitability for one-time or callback functions, are highlighted.</p>
<p>Moving on to Java, the lesson introduces lambda expressions that were introduced in 
Java 8 as a part of the language's support for functional programming. It 
explains the concept of functional interfaces and their connection to lambda 
expressions. A sample Java program demonstrates the syntax and application 
of lambda expressions with a functional interface. The lesson also emphasizes 
the versatility of lambda expressions in Java for various scenarios, including 
sorting collections, event handling, and higher-order functions.</p>
<p>In summary, the lesson emphasizes the significance of lambda expressions in 
both Python and Java, showcasing their practical use cases and advantages. By 
enabling developers to write concise and expressive code, lambda expressions 
promote functional programming styles and enhance the readability of code in 
these programming languages.</p>
	<h2><a name="What_is_a_lambda_expression">What is a lambda expression?</a></h2>
	<h3><a name="Lambda_expressions_in_general">Lambda expressions in general</a></h3>
			<p>In general, lambda expressions are a way to define anonymous 
			functions or function literals in programming languages. They are 
			often used in languages that support functional programming 
			paradigms, where functions can be treated as first-class citizens 
			and passed around as arguments or returned as values.</p>
<h3><a name="Lambda_expressions_in_Python">Lambda expressions in Python</a></h3>
			<p>In Python, lambda functions, also known as anonymous 
			functions, are small, one-line functions that don't require a 
			separate <code>def</code> statement. They are typically used when 
			you need a simple function that you don't plan to reuse elsewhere in 
			your code.</p>
			<p>A lambda expression in Python typically consists of the following 
			components:</p>
<div class="a">
<pre>lambda arguments: expression</pre>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>The <code>lambda</code> keyword signifies the beginning of a lambda 
	expression.</li>
	<li><code>arguments</code> refer to the input parameters of the function. 
	They can be optional if the lambda function doesn't require any arguments or 
	specified within parentheses.</li>
	<li>The <code>:</code> separates the arguments from the expression.</li>
	<li>The <code>expression</code> represents the logic or computation that the 
	lambda function performs and returns as a result.</li>
</ul>
			<p>Here is an example of the use of a lambda function in Python.</p>
<div class="a">
<pre>
square = lambda x: x ** 2
result = square(5)
print(result)  # Output: 25
</pre>
</div>
<p>In this example, the lambda function <code>square</code> takes a single 
argument <code>x</code> and calculates the square of <code>x</code>. When the 
lambda function is called with the argument <code>5</code>, it returns the 
result <code>25</code>, which is then printed to the console.</p>
<p>Lambda expressions in Python provide a concise and expressive way to write functions 
without explicitly naming them. They are particularly useful in scenarios where 
a function is used once or as a callback, eliminating the need to define a 
separate named function.</p>
<h3><a name="Lambda_expressions_in_Java">Lambda expressions in Java</a></h3>
<p>In Java, lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 as part of the 
language's support for functional programming. They enable the use of functional 
interfaces, which are interfaces with a single abstract method, often referred 
to as "functional interfaces" or "SAM (Single Abstract Method) interfaces."</p>
<p>The syntax for a lambda expression in Java is as follows:</p>

<div class="a">
<pre>(parameters) -&gt; expression
</pre>
</div>
<p>Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of a lambda expression in Java:</p>
<div class="a">
<pre>interface MathOperation {
    int operate(int x, int y);
}

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperation add = (x, y) -&gt; x + y;

        int result = add.operate(5, 3);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: 8
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>This Java code demonstrates the use of lambda expressions in combination with 
functional interfaces. Here's a breakdown of the code:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The code defines a functional interface named <code>MathOperation</code> 
	with a single abstract method called <code>operate</code>. This interface 
	represents a mathematical operation that takes two integers as input and 
	returns an integer as the result.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The <code>LambdaExample</code> class contains the <code>main</code> 
	method, which serves as the entry point of the program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Within the <code>main</code> method, a lambda expression is used to 
	create an instance of the <code>MathOperation</code> functional interface. 
	The lambda expression <code>(x, y) -&gt; x + y</code> takes two integers <code>
	x</code> and <code>y</code> as input and returns their sum <code>x + y</code>. 
	This lambda expression provides the implementation for the <code>operate</code> 
	method defined in the <code>MathOperation</code> interface.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The instance of <code>MathOperation</code> created by the lambda 
	expression is assigned to the variable <code>add</code>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Next, the <code>operate</code> method of the <code>add</code> instance is 
	called with the arguments <code>5</code> and <code>3</code>. This invokes 
	the lambda expression, resulting in the sum of <code>5</code> and <code>3</code>, 
	which is <code>8</code>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The resulting value, <code>8</code>, is stored in the variable <code>
	result</code>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Finally, the value of <code>result</code> is printed to the console using
	<code>System.out.println</code>, which outputs <code>8</code>.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the code demonstrates the usage of a lambda expression to 
implement a functional interface and perform a mathematical operation (addition 
in this case) with the provided values.</p>
	<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Lambda expressions in Java can be used in various contexts, such as sorting 
collections, implementing event handlers, or passing behaviors to higher-order 
functions like <code>forEach</code> or <code>map</code> in the Stream API. They 
provide a concise and readable way to write functional code, promoting a more 
functional style of programming in Java.</p>
<p>This lesson provides an overview of lambda expressions in programming 
languages, contrasting their usage in Python and Java. Lambda expressions are 
anonymous functions or function literals commonly used in languages that support 
functional programming paradigms. They allow functions to be treated as 
first-class citizens, enabling them to be passed as arguments or returned as 
values.</p>
<p>In Python, lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, 
one-line functions that don't require a separate "def" statement. They are 
useful for creating simple functions that don't need to be reused elsewhere. The 
structure of a lambda expression in Python consists of the lambda keyword, 
arguments (optional), a colon, and an expression representing the logic or 
computation performed by the lambda function. An example is provided to 
demonstrate the use of a lambda function to calculate the square of a number.</p>
<p>In Java, lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 as part of the 
language's support for functional programming. They are used in conjunction with 
functional interfaces, which have a single abstract method. The syntax for a 
lambda expression in Java involves specifying parameters, an arrow operator (-&gt;), and 
an expression. A code example is given to illustrate the usage of a lambda 
expression with a functional interface to perform a mathematical operation 
(addition in this case).</p>
<p>The lesson emphasizes the benefits of lambda expressions, such as their 
conciseness and expressiveness, as well as their suitability for scenarios where 
functions are used once or as callbacks. Lambda expressions promote a more 
functional style of programming by providing a compact and readable way to 
define functions without explicitly naming them.</p>
