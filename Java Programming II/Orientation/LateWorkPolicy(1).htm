<h2 class="auto-style1">Policy Regarding Late Work</h2>
<p><strong>Late assignments:</strong></p>
<p>If you are unable to earn credit for an assignment by its 
due date, you are still eligible to earn credit for the assignment. You can submit a correct solution for the assignment 
by 11:59 PM on the due date and time for the last assignment and 
receive 80-percent credit. </p>
<p>The determination as to what is late and what is not late will depend 
entirely on Blackboard. If Blackboard flags an assignment as LATE, it will be 
subject to a 20% late penalty regardless of how late it was submitted. Since 
your clock may not be synchronized with the clock in Blackboard, it would be 
wise for you to always submit your assignments at least a few minutes early 
according to your clock.</p>
<p><strong>Excessive missing assignments</strong></p>
<p>If you accumulate three or more missing assignments - meaning that neither an 
on-time nor a late submission was made for each of the missing assignments - you 
may be dropped from the course unless there is a very good reason for your 
failure to submit the assignments. In other words you may not put off submitting 
large numbers of assignments until the end of the semester expecting to receive credit for those assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Late quizzes and tests</strong></p>
<p>Quizzes and tests must be completed by their due dates in 
order to earn credit.</p>
