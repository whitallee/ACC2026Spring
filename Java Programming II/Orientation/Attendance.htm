<h2>"Attended" versus "Never Attended"</h2>
</center>



<p>During the first few days of every semester, each instructor in every course 
at ACC is required to report whether each student has "<strong>Attended</strong>" 
or "<strong>Never Attended</strong>." the course.<br/><br/><strong>Paraphrasing the 
requirement:</strong><br/><br/>As of 
09/21/16, attendance at an academically-related activity is defined by federal 
guidelines as:<br/><br/>1. Physical class attendance where there is direct 
interaction between instructor and student<br/>2. Submission of an academic 
assignment<br/>3. Examination, interactive tutorial or computer assisted 
instruction<br/>4. Study group as assigned by school<br/>5. Participation in <span>
online</span> discussion about academic matters<br/>6. Initiation of contact with 
instructor to ask question about academic subject<br/><br/>As of 09/21/16,<strong> selecting "Never 
Attended" will result in the student being automatically and administratively 
dropped from the course.</strong></p>
<p>As of 09/21/16, a student 
may appeal the non-attendance drop and request a reinstatement in writing within 
five (5) business days from the date they are notified. The written appeal must 
be made to the course instructor, who must respond in writing within five (5) 
business days. The student may appeal the instructors decision in writing within 
five (5) business days to the appropriate Department Chair, then Instructional 
Dean, whose decision is final.</p>
<p>While I have the ability to override the administrative non-attendance drop 
and reinstate a student, I will do so only under the most compelling 
circumstances. </p>
<p>Please also be aware that if you are reinstated, you will still be required 
to adhere to the same schedule for all assignments and tests being adhered to by 
the other students in the course.</p>
<p><strong class="auto-style2">In this course, all students who fail to earn 100 
points on orientation Test00 on or before the date shown on the Gradebook 
page will be reported to have "Never Attended", which will result in the student 
being automatically and administratively dropped from the course. </strong></p>
<p>Completion of Orientation Test00 
will be considered as having satisfied both Item 2 and Item 3 in the above list. 
Items 1, 4, 5, and 6 in the above list do not count as "Attended" in this 
course.</p>
