<h3><a name="Preface">Preface</a></h3>
<p>DO NOT use the Blackboard <strong><em>Messages</em></strong> system to 
communicate with your instructor. That system is not monitored by your 
instructor and you will not get a response if you use it.</p>
<p>By design, this is an asynchronous section of the course. There are no 
scheduled interactions between the instructor and the students. The only 
scheduled events are the due dates for assignments and tests. If you need 
synchronous interaction with your instructor, you should probably transfer to a 
different section of the course.</p>
<p>Asynchronous interactions with your instructor primarily take place using 
email, phone, and video conferencing.</p>
<h3><a name="Email">Email</a></h3>
<h4><a name="Spam_blocking_software_"><span class="style1">Spam blocking software</span> 
</a> </h4>
<p>I receive several hundred emails every day. Many contain viruses or worms. Most of the rest are SPAM.
<br />
</p>
<p>Whenever you send a new email to me, you <strong>MUST</strong> compose and 
send the email from your ACC email account. Also, you must structure the <strong>
Subject</strong> line of the email as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>Name, ITSE-2317-zzz, wwwww, Topic</strong></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> is the name under which you are enrolled in the 
	course (Sam Smith for example)</li>
	<li><strong>zzz</strong> is the section number of the course (002 for 
	example)</li>
	<li><strong>wwwww</strong> is the five digit number assigned to your course 
	(86074 for example)</li>
	<li><strong>Topic</strong> is the topic of the email</li>
</ul>
<p>An example subject line follows:</p>
<pre><strong>Sam Smith, ITSE-2317-002, 86074, Question regarding Asg03</strong></pre>
<p>When I see that format, I will trust that the email is safe to open and read. 
Otherwise, I will assume that your email contains a virus or constitutes SPAM, 
and I will simply delete your email without reading it. </p>
<p>(Note that the format of the email that you are required to send following 
submission of an assignment is different. See that format elsewhere in this 
orientation material.) </p>

<h4><a name="Questions_via_Email_">Questions via Email
</a>
</h4>
<p>From time to time you may need to ask questions via email, and I encourage you
to do so. However, please make the question as specific as possible. For
example, "What is OOP?" is not a question that I can easily answer via email. </p>
<p>When appropriate, please illustrate your question with a short sample 
program. When you send a sample program, please observe several important 
rules: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Don't send isolated code fragments. Send a complete program that is 
	ready for me to paste into a java file and attempt to compile.</li>
	<li>Make the program as simple as possible while still illustrating your 
	question. Eliminate all superfluous code that isn't necessary to illustrate 
	the question.</li>
</ul>
<p>II am here to help you, so don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it.</p>
<h4><a name="Response_to_Email_">Response to Email </a></h4>
<p>I normally respond to student 
emails within 24 hours except on weekends. If you send an email to 
me and you don't receive a response within
24 hours <em>(allow 72 hours on weekends)</em>,, make certain that your Subject line is
correctly formatted and send the email again.</p>


<h4><span class="style2"><a name="Do_not_send_executable_attachments">Do not send executable attachments</a></span></h4>
<p>If you send an email to me, DO NOT attach any
executable files, even if they are encapsulated in a zip file. If your email 
contains executable attachments, the Gmail system will simply discard it and I 
will never see it. This includes
files with the following extensions, just to name a few:</p>

<p>.exe<br />
 .com<br />
 .scr<br />
 .bat<br />
 .pif<br />
 .vb</p>

<p>The following file extensions should be OK:</p>

<p>.java<br />
 .class<br />
 .htm<br />
 .html<br />
 .css<br />
 .xml<br />
 .xsl<br />
 .doc<br />
 .zip <i>(Provided the zip file doesn't contain any executable files.)</i></p>

<p>If you find it necessary to attach a questionable file for any reason, you
should also send another email without an attachment notifying me that you
sent the questionable file as an attachment so that I can be on the lookout for
it.</p>

<h4><span class="style2"><a name="Your_official_Email_address">Your official Email address</a></span></h4>
<p>It is my understanding that all ACC students have 
been provided
an official email address by ACC, and that address is reflected in all
official ACC student records. I have been told that you can cause emails
sent to that address to be forwarded to the email address of your choice. You
should make it a point to check your ACC
email, or your Bb emails on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When I need to send a broadcast email to all students in the course, I will 
normally send that email via Qwickly Email, which will automatically forward it 
to your official ACC email address.</p>
<p>When I need to send an email to you as an individual, I will send that email 
via ACC email to your official ACC email address.</p>
<h3><a name="Phone">Phone</a></h3>
<p>Please feel free to call me at (512) 223-4758 any time during office hours. </p>
<p>If you call and I don't answer, feel free to leave a voice mail. Note 
however that my office phone is forwarded to my cell phone so I don't 
automatically get a callback number. If you leave a voice mail, please 
speak clearly and be sure to leave a callback number. It would also be a good 
idea to send an email and remind me to check my voice mail.</p>
<h3><a name="Video_Conference">Video Conference</a></h3>
<p>If you prefer a face-to-face conversation, or you need to show me some code, 
I will be happy to join you in a video conference using either Google Meet during office hours. We can set that up using either 
email or phone.</p>
<h3><a name="Feedback_on_Assignments">Feedback on Assignments</a></h3>
<p>You will have access to all assignments from the first day of class and you 
are encouraged to complete and submit them early. I normally grade your 
assignments within 24 hours after you submit them in Bb. </p>
<p>If you submit a correct solution to an assignment, I normally won't contact 
you. I will simply enter your grade in Bb. You can set notification features in 
Bb so that you will be automatically notified when I enter your grade.</p>
<p>If you submit an incorrect solution to an assignment, I will provide feedback 
in a manner that is described elsewhere in this orientation material. You will 
then be given an opportunity to correct your problems and submit another 
attempt.</p>
<h3><a name="Feedback_on_Tests">Feedback on Tests</a></h3>
<p>You will have access to all tests from the first day of class and you are 
encouraged to complete and submit them early.</p>
<p>Tests are graded automatically in Bb and you will receive feedback when you 
complete and submit a test. If you submit your first attempt early, you will 
be given another attempt to take the test provided that you can accomplish that 
before the deadline expires.</p>
<h3><a name="Discussion_on_any_Course_Topic">Discussion on any Course Topic</a></h3>
<p>I am here to help you learn the material and successfully complete the 
course. Please don't hesitate to contact me on any topic related to the course.</p>
<p>Prof. Baldwin</p>
