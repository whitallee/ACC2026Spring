<h3 class="auto-style2"><a name="General"></a>General</h3>
<p>Failure to comply with these instructions usually results in a failing grade
for the assignment, often zero. </p>

<p>The assignments for this course are take-home assignments. You may use any 
reference material that you have available. However, you are instructed not to 
obtain assistance from anyone in completing your assignments. </p>
<p>On the other hand, you are encouraged to get assistance from your instructor, 
from ACC tutors, or from others if needed to understand the material in the 
course eBooks or the supplementary reading material.</p>

<h3 class="auto-style2"><a name="Downloading_and_Submitting_Assignments">
Downloading and Submitting Assignments</a></h3>

<p>Assignments are posted in Blackboard. There is a zip file associated with 
each assignment that you can download from Blackboard. The zip file contains the 
specifications for the assignment.</p>
<p>The following two sets of instructions describe the complete cycle of downloading, 
completing, and submitting an assignment as of 02/19/25 The details may 
change over time as the Blackboard software is updated.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select <strong>LEARNING ACTIVITIES</strong> on the main <strong>Content</strong> 
	page.</li>
	<li>Open the relevant <strong>CLO</strong> folder.</li>
	<li>Open the folder for the module of interest (MLO-1.1 for example).</li>
	<li>Scroll down the page until you find a link named
	<strong>AsgXX</strong> where XX is the assignment number. Click that link.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>View Instructions </strong>button on the bottom right. This will expose a 
	page showing a zip file on the left side of the page.</li>
	<li>Click the ellipses menu to the right of the zip file and download the 
	zip file.</li>
	<li>Click the large X in the upper-left corner to dismiss the page. You will 
	come back to it later to submit your solution.</li>
	<li>Extract the contents of the zip file into an empty folder and open the specification file named 
	<strong>ProjXX.htm</strong> in your browser. Again, XX is the assignment 
	number.</li>
	<li>Complete your assignment according to the specifications given in the 
	file named <strong>ProjXX.htm</strong>. </li>
	

</ol>

<p>All of the assignments in this course require that you create a zip file 
containing the solution files for the assignment. Once you have done that and 
you are ready to submit your assignment, follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>


	<li>Reopen the assignment page as described above. </li>
	<li>Click the <strong>View instructions</strong> button on the bottom right. This will open a page with a
	<strong>Submission</strong> heading near 
	the bottom.</li>
	<li>Drag and drop your solution zip file into the space below the heading.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Save</strong> button on the small <strong>Edit File 
	Options</strong> 
	window that opens.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Submit</strong> button on the bottom right of the 
	assignment 
	page.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Submit</strong> button on the small <strong>Submit 
	Assignment</strong> window that opens.</li>
	<li>Click either the <strong>Close</strong> button or the <strong>Download</strong> 
	button in the small receipt window that opens.</li>
	<li>Click the large X button in the upper-right to return to the main 
	Content page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively you can skip the first few steps in the first list above by selecting
<strong>Shortcuts</strong> on the main <strong>Content</strong> page and then 
selecting the assignment of interest.</p>
<h3><a name="Submission_Confirmation_Email">Submission Confirmation Email</a></h3>
<p>Immediately following the submission of each new assignment attempt, you must 
open your ACC email and send an email to <a href="mailto:baldwin@austincc.edu">
baldwin@austincc.edu</a> with the subject line constructed as shown below. If 
you fail to send the email, your attempt will be ignored and won't be graded.</p>
<p>The subject line of your email must be constructed as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>name, ITSE-2317-WWW, XXXXX, AsgYY, Attempt ZZ submitted</strong></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>name</strong> is the name under which you are enrolled in the 
	course, such as Sam Smith.</li>
	<li><strong>WWW</strong> is the section number, such as 001</li>
	<li><strong>XXXXX</strong> is the five-digit number assigned to the course, 
	such as 86074</li>
	<li><strong>YY</strong> is the assignment number, such as Asg03</li>
	<li><strong>ZZ</strong> is the attempt number such as 02</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample subject line constructed according to this requirement follows:</p>
<pre><strong>Sam Smith, ITSE-2317-001, 86074, Asg03, Attempt 02 submitted</strong></pre>
<h3 class="style3"><a
name="Format_of_downloadable_zip_file">Format of Downloadable Zip File</a></h3>
<p>The zip files for the assignments that you will download contain some or all of the following material:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An assignment specification document <i>(<strong>Proj01.htm</strong> for example)</i>.</li>
	<li>A source code file for the driver class for the program <em>(<strong>Proj03.java</strong> 
	for example). </em></li>
	<li>A text file containing skeleton code for the assignment <em>(</em><strong><em>Proj03Skeleton.txt</em></strong><em> 
	for example).</em></li>
	<li>Any other files that you may need, such as image files, to complete 
	the assignment.</li>
 

</ul>

<p>Each assignment requires that you write one program. Extract the contents of 
the zip file into an empty folder. Then open the <strong>
ProjXX.htm</strong> file in your browser to view the
programming specifications for the assignment.</p>

<h3 class="style1">
<a name="Dont_use_NetBeans,_Eclipse,_or_other_high-level_IDEs">Don't use NetBeans, Eclipse, or other high-level IDEs</a></h3>
<p>NetBeans, Eclipse, and other high-level IDEs are excellent productivity tools
for programmers in the workplace who are working on large projects, who know
exactly what they are doing, and who have a need to become more productive in
their programming efforts. However, to write the simple programs required for this course, you should
need nothing more sophisticated than a text editor and the Oracle Java Development Kit <i>(JDK).</i> The use of a high-level IDE to write the programs required
for this course is overkill, can lead to problems, and is not recommended.</p>

<b></b> 

<h3 class="auto-style2"><a name="Special_Instructions_Regarding_the_Submi"></a>Special Instructions Regarding the 
Submission of
Assignments</h3>
<p>You may submit each assignment an unlimited number of times. </p>
<p>The due dates for all assignments can be found by selecting <strong>Gradebook</strong> 
on the navigation bar.</p>

<h4>Your name</h4>
<p>Your name is required one or more times in the output for every program and the program
specifications will indicate where your name must appear. If there is any confusion as to where your name 
must appear, please discuss this with me at least one week prior to the 
assignment deadline. <i>(If your name
does not appear, I will assume that the material you
submitted does not constitute your own work and you will not get credit for the 
assignment.)</i></p>

<h4><a name="Separate_class_and_interface_definitions">Separate class and interface definitions</a></h4>
<p>Every class definition <em>(including the driver class that I provide)</em> and every interface definition 
should be contained in a 
separate source code file with an extension of .java. <strong><em>Give the file the same 
name as the class or interface that the file defines.</em></strong></p>
<p>Each such file must include any required <strong><em>import</em></strong> 
declarations.</p>
<p><span class="auto-style2"><strong>None of the files may include a </strong>
</span> <strong class="auto-style1"><em><span class="auto-style3">package</span></em></strong><span class="auto-style2"><strong> 
declaration.</strong></span></p>
<h4>Submit source code files only</h4>
<p>You must <strong><em>submit only your Java source code files</em></strong> encapsulated in a 
<strong>zip</strong> file. Do not submit <strong>rar</strong> files. Do not submit class files. If you do submit 
class files, they will simply be overwritten 
when I compile and execute your programs. If you submit <strong>rar</strong> 
files, your submission will not be accepted.</p>
<h4>Your name in the zip file</h4>
<p>Include your name and the assignment number in the name of the zip file that you submit to help me 
avoid getting your zip file mixed up with another student&#39;s zip file when I 
retrieve them from Blackboard. A suitable example file name is shown below but 
other formats would be acceptable as well. I just need to be able to connect the 
zip file to you and to the assignment number.</p>
<p><em>Asg01_baldwin.zip</em></p>

<h4>Code compatibility</h4>
<p>The required Java version will be specified in the syllabus for your 
course for the semester in which you are enrolled. </p>

<h4>Testing your programs</h4>

<p>Don't rely on an IDE to test your programs. Test your source code for each program from the command line using
Oracle's <b>javac.exe</b> and <b>java.exe</b> programs. Confirm that your 
programs conform to the program specifications before submitting your 
assignments. 
</p>
<p>To avoid possible class file collision problems, delete all of the class files 
produced by one version of your program before testing the next version of your program 
or before testing your next program in the same folder.</p>
<h4>No partial credit</h4>

<p>I will score your programs from the <strong>Windows</strong> command line.
<em>(In case you develop under a different OS, make certain that your programs 
are compatible with Windows.)</em> Each program will be graded either correct or 
incorrect.</p>
<p><b>Partial credit will
not be given</b> for source code that does not fully conform to
these instructions and to the program specifications. However, you are allowed 
unlimited attempts for each assignment. Your highest score among the scores for each assignment will 
be used to compute your final grade. </p>
<p>I will provide feedback and will be happy to discuss your attempts with you if your attempts fail to meet the specifications.</p>
<p>After copying your source code files into a folder identified by <strong><em>YourName</em></strong> on 
my M-drive , I will test your program by executing 
a batch file containing code in that folder similar to the following:</p>
<table style="width: 100%" class="style5">
	<tr>
		<td>
		<pre>
copy ..\_Solution\Proj01.java

del *.class
javac -cp .; Proj01.java
java -cp .; Proj01
</pre>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h4>What does this mean?</h4>
<p>Briefly, it means that 
I will copy my version of <strong>ProjXX.java </strong>into 
the folder identified by <strong><em>YourName</em></strong>, overwriting your file having the same name 
if there is one. Next I will delete any old class files that may be in that 
folder. 
Then I will attempt to compile and execute your program using the required version of Java.</p>
<p>As of this writing, a fairly good tutorial on the <em>Windows Command Prompt</em> 
is available
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/cmd-prompt.html">
here</a>.</p>


<h4>Extraneous Material</h4>
<p>Do not submit extra files such as
<b>readme.txt</b> files and expect me to pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Do not expect me to pay attention to text that you may choose to enter into 
the Blackboard text fields when you submit your solution zip file.</p>
<p>Do not expect me to pay attention to 
comments in your source code files.</p>
<h4>The required material</h4>
<p>All I expect to
receive from you when you submit your assignment is the set of required source code 
files and the email described earlier. <em>(In many cases, there will only be one source code file with a name 
like <strong>ProjXXRunner.java</strong>)</em> There is
no reason that you will need to communicate any information about your 
assignment to
me when you submit it. Any need to discuss the requirements of the assignment must be
satisfied prior to your submission of the assignment.</p>

<p>Encapsulate an electronic copy of the required material in a zip file and submit it as 
a Blackboard assignment. If you are running Windows, you don't 
need a special program to create the zip file. The Windows file compression 
utility is entirely adequate.</p>

<p>The zip file must be one that I can unzip using the Windows de-compression 
utility
with no effort required on my part other than to open the file and extract the
material contained therein. There must be no requirement for any sort of
special decoding. If there is such a requirement, I will not accept the 
assignment.
For example, do not submit a <strong>rar</strong> file.</p>
<h3><a name="Be_careful_what_you_copy">Be careful what you copy</a></h3>
<p>There is nothing wrong with using the code from an existing program as a template for a new program. Professional programmers do that all the time. However, if you do that, you should do it in a thoughtful and judicious way.

</p>
<p>When writing code for an assignment, don't simply copy an entire existing program into your new program with the intent of modifying it to meet the assignment specifications, even if the existing program appears to be close to what you need.

</p>
<p>Instead, you should first make certain that you really do understand the requirements of the assignment. Don't write or copy any code until you have that understanding.

</p>
<p>Then you should examine each statement in the existing program and make certain that you understand the purpose and behavior of each statement. If you don't understand the purpose and behavior of a statement in an existing program, don't even consider copying it into your assignment program.

</p>
<p>If you copy code from an existing program into your assignment program, you should copy statements from the existing program into the new program one statement at a time. You should make certain that each statement is both needed and appropriate for the new program before you copy the statement.

</p>
<p>A sample program may be useful in helping you to write the new code for an assignment. However, that code is only helpful if you truly understand the code in the sample program and understand the requirements of the assignment. The availability of code in a sample program can be detrimental to your success in writing the code for an assignment if fail to copy and use that code in a thoughtful and judicious way.</p>
