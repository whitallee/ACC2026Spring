<p><strong>The Blackboard learning management system</strong></p>
<p>The primary organizational tool for this course is the
<a href="https://acconline.austincc.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp">Blackboard</a> 
(Bb) learning management system. Navigation among the course elements is 
provided by the <strong><em>navigation bar</em></strong> that normally appears at the top of your screen 
or in a <strong><em>hamburger menu</em></strong> for smaller screens. The Bb system will be used for communicating with students, such as 
reporting grades, posting announcements, sending emails to individual 
students, and broadcasting emails to all students enrolled in the 
course.</p>
<p>The Bb <em>Assignment</em> and <em>Test</em> features are the mechanisms that 
you will use to submit your assignments and take your tests</p>
<p><strong>The textbook</strong></p>
<p>The <a name="primary_textbook">primary textbooks</a> for this course are three free eBooks that you can download by
<a name="selecting_the_eBook">selecting the eBook</a> links on 
the main Content page. <em>(Select <strong>Content</strong> on the navigation 
bar.)</em></p>
<p>Students are also encouraged to make use of the free online resources shown 
below as supplemental learning material.</p>

	<li>
	<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

	Kjell, Central Connecticut State University.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality Matters</strong></p>
<p>This course, was designed according to the standards of <a href="https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards/higher-ed-rubric">
The Quality Matters Higher Education Rubric Sixth Edition</a>. As such, the 
course was designed around a hierarchy of properly aligned <em>Course Level Objectives (CLOs), Module Level Objectives (MLOs),</em> 
and <em>Learning Activities (LAs)</em>. The alignment among these elements is shown in a 
course map that you can view by selecting the <strong>Course Map</strong> link 
on the main Content page. </p>
<p><strong>The schedule</strong></p>
<p>The general schedule of course activities progresses from the top to the 
bottom of the course map. The calendar schedule of activities can be viewed by 
selecting <strong>Gradebook</strong> on the navigation bar.</p>
<p>You can view a list of activities required from the start to the finish of the course 
by selecting <strong>Content/Start Here/Getting Started</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The course is structured with three Course Level Objectives, about a dozen 
Module Level Objectives, and many Learning Activities.</p>
<p>The Learning Activities consist of readings from the eBook, tests keyed to the readings, 
and programming assignments keyed to the readings. </p>
<p>The tests and assignments can 
be accessed by selecting <strong>Content/LEARNING ACTIVITIES</strong>, 
selecting the relevant CLO, selecting the relevant MLO, and scrolling down and 
selecting the relevant test or assignment. They can also be accessed directly by 
selecting <strong>Content/Shortcuts</strong> and then selecting the relevant 
test or assignment.</p>
