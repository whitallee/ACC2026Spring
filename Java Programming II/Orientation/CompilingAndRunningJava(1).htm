<h2 class="auto-style1">Compiling and Running Java Programs from the Command Line</h2>
<p>You don't need an IDE to compile and run Java programs. Once you get things 
set up, it is very easy to compile and run them from the command line. All you 
need is the Java Development Kit (jdk) that you can download from Oracle and a 
text editor. Detailed instructions for Windows are provided below. If you are 
using a different operating system, you will need to translate the instructions 
into that operating system.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Make certain that you can see file extensions such as .java, .bat, .txt, 
	etc. If not, you may need to adjust your preferences.</li>
	<li>Download and install the Java SE Development Kit from
	<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">Oracle</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Create an empty folder somewhere on your disk</li>
	<li>Create an empty text file named aacmd.bat in that folder. <em>(Note .bat and 
	not .txt.)</em></li>
	<li>Use your text editor to put the following line of text in that file and 
	close the file: <br/>cmd</li>
	<li>Double click that file. This will cause a command-line window to open 
	with a command prompt shown by the &gt; character.</li>
	<li>Type the following at the command prompt and press Enter: <br/>javac -version<br/>
	This should display text that shows the version of the Java compiler that 
	you have installed.</li>
	<li>Type the following at the command prompt and press Enter: <br/>java -version<br/>
	This should display text that shows the version of the Java Virtual Machine 
	(JVM) that you have installed </li>
	<li>If everything has worked to this point, this confirms that you have 
	Java properly installed and ready for use. If not, you might want to seek 
	help from the ACC CSIT tutors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Compiling and running programs</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Create an empty text file in that same folder named HelloWorld.java. 
	<em>(Note .java and not .txt.)</em> This is a simple Java source code file.</li>
	<li>Use your text editor to enter the following Java code in the file:<br/>
	class HelloWorld {<br/>public static void main(String[] args) {<br/>System.out.println("Hello, World!");<br/>}//end method<br/>}//end class</li>
	<li>Double click the file named aacmd.bat to open the command-line screen.</li>
	<li>Enter the following command at the command prompt: <br/>javac&nbsp; -cp 
	.; HelloWorld.java<br/>
	If there are no errors, the command prompt will reappear. If you examine the 
	folder, you will see that it now contains a new file named HelloWorld.class. 
	This is a compiled Java file ready to run.</li>
	<li>Enter the following command at the command prompt: <br/>java -cp .; HelloWorld<br/>The following output should appear on the screen:<br/>Hello, World!</li>
	<li>If 
	everything has worked to this point, this confirms that you have 
	successfully created, compiled, and executed a simple Java program. If not, 
	you might want to seek help from the ACC CSIT tutors.</li>
	<li>From this point forward, each time you update your source code file or 
	create a new source code file, you should execute the following commands at 
	the command prompt:<br/>del *.class<br/>javac -cp .; fileName.java<br/>java -cp 
	.; fileName</li>
