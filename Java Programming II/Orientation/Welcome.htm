<p>Hello students. My name is Richard G. Baldwin and I have been teaching computer programming 
at ACC for more than thirty years. I wrote my first computer program in Fortran in 
1962 shortly after receiving my BSEE degree from W.Va. University. I went on to 
earn an MSEE degree from SMU in 1965 while working at Texas Instruments in 
Dallas.</p>
<p>I joined some of my colleagues and we started our own company in 1967 where I worked in the high-tech industry in Dallas and Austin 
until 1994. My 
specialty was digital signal processing, otherwise known as DSP. Then I retired 
and joined the faculty at ACC.</p>
<p>I taught one of the earliest distance learning courses at ACC around 1995 and 
have been teaching classroom and distance learning courses ever since. My first 
distance learning course was a C++ course.</p>

<p>I taught the first Java OOP course at ACC around 1997 and have taught six or more Java programming classes per year since then. In addition to this course, I also teach 
a beginning Java programming course each semester. My previous Java students number in the thousands. I also teach Python, Data Science, 
game math, and game programming.</p>
