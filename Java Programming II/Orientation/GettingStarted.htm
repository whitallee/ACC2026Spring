<h2>Getting Started</h2>
</center>



<p>The logical steps for getting started and completing this course are listed below. </p>

	<p>1. Having read the Welcome page, you should continue by reading the syllabus in its entirety.</p>
	<p>2. Next you should select <strong>Announcements</strong> in the 
	navigation bar and read all of the announcements.  </p>
<p>3. Next you should select <strong>Content</strong> in the navigation bar, 
select <strong>ORIENTATION</strong>, and complete your orientation.</p>
<p>4. Once you have completed orientation, select <strong>Content</strong> in the navigation bar 
and 
select <strong>Course Map</strong> to open 
	the course map document in your browser. Study the relationships among the 
	Course Level Objectives (CLOs), the Module Level Objectives (MLOs), and the 
	Learning Activities(LAs). Then select <strong>Gradebook</strong> in the 
navigation bar. Each of the learning 
	activities in the course map for which a 
	grade will be assigned should appear in the <strong>Item</strong> column. The submission deadline for 
	each learning activity is shown in the <strong>Due Date</strong> column. In the event that you don't understand 
	these relationships, request clarification from your instructor.</p>
	<p>5. Next you should select <strong>Content</strong> in the navigation bar, 
	select <strong>Collections eBook</strong>, and then click the three-dot 
	button. Download the 
	zip file containing the free eBook. Extract the contents of the zip file 
	into an empty folder. Open the file named <strong>index.htm</strong>, which contains a 
	<strong>Table 
	of Contents</strong>. The Table of Contents has 
	links to each chapter in the eBook.</p>
	<p>6. Go back to the <strong>Course Map</strong> and make certain that you understand how 
	the reading assignments for chapters in the eBook correlate with the schedule 
	for tests and assignments. Again, if&nbsp; you don't understand something, 
	ask your instructor for clarification.</p>
	<p>7. Next you should select <strong>Content</strong> in the navigation bar 
	and select <strong>LEARNING ACTIVITIES</strong>. This will open a page 
	containing links to three <strong>CLO</strong> folders:
	<strong>CLO-1</strong>, <strong>CLO-2</strong>, and <strong>CLO-3</strong>.</p>
<p>8. Open the folder named
	<strong>CLO-1</strong>. There you will find four <strong>MLO</strong> 
	folders. Each folder corresponds to a Module Learning Objective (MLO) in the 
course map. </p>
	<p>9. Open the folder named <strong>MLO-1.1</strong> and open the page named
	<strong>Objectives, Read, and Do</strong>. Study the 
	contents of that page in order from top to bottom. Then close that page and 
	complete <strong>Quiz01</strong> and <strong>Asg01</strong> in whichever 
	order you prefer.</p>
	<p>10. Having completed <strong>Quiz01</strong> and <strong>Asg01</strong>, 
	go back and select <strong>LEARNING ACTIVITIES</strong>, <strong>CLO-1</strong>, 
	and <strong>MLO-1.2</strong> and repeat the process to complete <strong>Quiz02</strong> 
	and <strong>Asg02</strong>. </p>
<p>11. Continue to repeat this process until you have completed <strong>
	Quiz04</strong>, and <strong>Asg12</strong>. At that point, you will have 
finished the course.</p>



	<p>As you complete these steps, be mindful of the schedule shown on the 
	<strong>Gradebook</strong> page to avoid missing a deadline. As further insurance 
	against missing a deadline, you are encouraged to take 
	your tests and submit your assignment early.</p>
<p>Have a good semester and be sure to ask questions if you don't understand 
something.</p>
