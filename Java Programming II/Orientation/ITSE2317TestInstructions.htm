<strong>Gradebook</strong> on the navigation bar.</p>
<h3>An orientation test</h3>
<p><strong>Test00 </strong>is an open-book, open-computer, online 
Blackboard (Bb) test. You may take the test as many times as you need from any computer 
that allows you to log into your Bb course. </p>
<p>The test contains one question. The purpose of the test is to confirm that 
you have completed your online orientation. Do the following to complete the 
test.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select <strong>Orientation</strong> on the main <strong>Content</strong> page.</li>
	<li>Scroll down and select <strong>Orientation Test00</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Start attempt Y</strong> button on the bottom right, where Y is the number of the attempt for the 
	test. </li>
