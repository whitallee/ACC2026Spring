Question 1
1
True/False
Listing 1 causes the following text to appear on the screen:
44321

  True
X False



Question 2
2
True/False
In Listing 1, the fillIt method can call the add method on the incoming object with confidence that the behavior of the add method will be appropriate for the specific type of object involved.

X True
  False

Feedback
For example, the behavior of the add method for an object of the TreeSet class will probably be different from the behavior of the add method for an object of some other class that implements the Collection interface.



Question 3
3
True/False
In Listing 1, when the fillIt method returns, the TreeSet object contains five elements.

  True
X False



Question 4
4
True/False
The program shown in Listing 2 instantiates a TreeSet object and populates it with approximately 10,000,000 elements.

  True
X False



Question 5
5
True/False
Listing 1 instantiates an object of the TreeSet class and stores the object's reference in a reference variable of type Object named ref.

  True
X False



Question 6
6
True/False
The Iterator interface declares three methods:
hasNext()
next()
remove()

X True
  False



Question 7
7
True/False
In general, the time required for the contains method to find a value in a TreeSet object is more than the time required for the contains method to find a value in an ArrayList object.

  True
X False



Question 8
8
True/False
Given: in Listing 1, when the fillIt method returns, the TreeSet object contains four (not five) elements with no duplicates. Each element is a reference to an object of type Integer. Those references are maintained in such a way as to make them accessible in descending order, based on the int values encapsulated in each of the Integer objects.

  True
X False



Question 9
9
True/False
The program shown in Listing 2 compares the search speed of the ArrayList class and the TreeSet class.

X True
  False



Question 10
10
True/False
There will always be exactly 2,000,000 elements in the TreeSet object in Listing 2 after it is populated.

  True
X False



Question 11
11
True/False
Listing 2 calls the get method on the ArrayList object. The ArrayList class implements the List interface. The get method of the List interface is inherited from the  Collection interface.

  True
X False



Question 12
12
True/False
The ArrayList object in Listing 2 may contain duplicate values.

  True
X False



Question 13
13
True/False
The while loop in the Worker class in Listing 1 traverses the collection
Accessing each of the object's elements in succession, and
Displaying the value encapsulated in the object referred to by each element.

X True
  False



Question 14
14
True/False
An Iterator object can be used to traverse a  Collection object, gaining access to each element in order.

  True
X False



Question 15
15
True/False
The code in Listing 2 instantiates an ArrayList object and populates it with exactly 2,000,000 random values that are different from the random values contained in the TreeSet object.

  True
X False
